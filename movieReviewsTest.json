                "for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend there are certain rules that he needs to follow firstly fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship secondly buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes thirdly find the perfect moment and location to propose finally the groomwannabe should probably get her parent's blessing of these four the last one can be a nightmare meeting parents is a rite of passage fraught with unexpected questions bouts of nervousness the reality of being disliked and the inability to make a positive impression if you're lucky things will go smoothly but if you're greg focker ben stiller everything will go wrong and with a name like that how could it not when greg first meets his fianc e's father jack byrnes the grimacing robert deniro greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive when he tells jack that he's a male nurse the incorrigible dad shoots back not many men in your profession huh greg it's definitely not a good start but greg is determined to win him over and it's this desire that fuels the movie he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner it doesn't matter that he's jewish if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace then that's what he's going to gamely do oh god you're such a good god he moons his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle but when jack gives him the deniro squint that familiar unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility it's pretty hard not to grin things get progressively worse for greg and that's too bad because he's a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart eventually he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up committing a host of gaffes that embarrass humiliate or injure other people it's a neverending ordeal of missteps miscues and mistakes he buys some champagne but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances he tries to find jack's missing cat but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble and there are several other episodes each one trumping the next in outrageousness the more our wellmeaning beau screwed up the more the audience groaned in sympathy we liked greg and we liked this movie meet the parents is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments just sit back and watch greg get into trouble no matter what the situation whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house things will horribly go wrong we laugh at greg's expense but love often makes a person do dumb things and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool deniro is also affable tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside their tugofwar is often funny the slapstick is elaborate and there are several topical throwaway gags mostly targeted at the airline industry to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future inlaws from hell",

                "after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles as a master would teach an eager apprentice you caress the noodles with the chopsticks he says then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying 'see you soon ' of course it's meant to be a parody but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat not something you like not something you enjoy but rather something you experience experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts trust me you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western set in modern day japan a stranger goro tsutomu yamazaki comes into town and finds tampopo nobuko miyamoto the proprietor of a small holeinthewall noodle shop trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman pisken rikiya yasuoka goro to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen emerging bloodied but victorious goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away just to eat a bowl of her ramen the problem is her fare is something less than popular and less than appetizing however goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert enlist the aid of a wealthy patron and make friends with the former enemy this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems take for example when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner the price is too high but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum tampopo meets him at his store late at night and he leads her to a back room she protests thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives but he insists just when she is about to bolt for the exit he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience this scene while comical is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation then of relief and discovery there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who despite their economic trappings are all gourmets and master sommeliers we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet the scene is meant to bring a laugh but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor food is something which everyone has in common and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor surrounded by her children she is obviously in her last hours of life her husband comes home and seeing her worsened condition demands that she get up and make dinner the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this in a near miracle the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal then brings it to her awaiting family as the family eats she looks on them and smiles preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her and for a brief moment she too enjoys the normalcy then she falls over dead for a moment the family is stunned but then the father yells at the children keep eating this is the last meal your mother ever made crying as they do so the family finishes the meal the scene is comical awkward moving and beautiful by including the vignettes itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film but surprisingly they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline instead they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble because the film parodies a western the construction of the plot is fairly predictable but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the good guys come together for the final showdown in this case the showdown is against the ramen if they eat tampopo's ramen soup and all tampopo knows she has succeeded it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life you can afford to cut it a little slack",

the scripts for a miniseries called a for andromeda afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission the construction of a huge computer the computer's analysis of life on earth and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the thenunknown julie christie audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel andromeda breakthrough which played to equally high ratings dennis feldman whose previous credits include the golden child has never been noted for coherent wellstructured movie scripts they start out great and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl feldman writes good scenes but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie even with a previous version to use as a model now in species we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter gore and chases species features ben kingsley who is completely wasted in a badlywritten portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script the species story is relatively simple we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since and have been receiving answers for two years note that in the 's we really didn't know diddly about the human genome structure and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings even today all we can do is give information about dna and how it works not a copy of human dna because we don't have it analyzed yet the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race and doctor xavier finch played by ben kingsley is placed in charge of the attempt the script begins to go off the deep end at this point when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shapeshift into any of several ugly alien life forms the first half of the film has something to offer as sil the alien girl struggles with her multiform existence changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society with glaring gaps where her social skills should be her instincts are to mate and procreate and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area escaping from her birth laboratory in utah sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her she goes on an eating binge spins herself a cocoon and emerges as an adult played by natasha henstridge who goes a long way toward recreating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in the pursuers michael madsen is an assassinexterminator forrest whitaker is a convenient empathpsychic just as though the u s government actually had such people on call neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided whitaker's role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek the next generation's counselor cleavage the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals too good to not work to the best of their abilities but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak h r giger's design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly the main fault of species is lack of originality it starts out with a wonderful albeit borrowed premise and then doesn't live up to it all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes with a few monsters tossed in there is no buildup of tension and suspense no climax worthy of the name species is just a sequence of scare scenes stuck together the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes but not rescued by them on the other hand as an exercise in scifi action adventure it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board but by and large it's fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing my personal rating is three stars but knock one or two of those off if you don't enjoy

                "review a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in th century flanders living with his grandfather jehan jack warden in poverty nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times they are renting a spare oneroom cottage and the greedy malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them out of the house' if they don't pay the rent nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen in either a movie or in real life his hero is peter paul rubens the great flemish painter of the th century not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy however he has a dog of flanders whom he names patrasche who is a heroic rintintin of the th century whom he rescues from his cruel unkind master in addition he even has a best friend and future sweetheart in the lovely wealthy aloise whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with lowerclass' nello he thinks he's not good enough for her and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying but then he was a poor guy himself before he married as mentioned later on in the film one day nello encounters a mysterious yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande played wonderfully by jon voight who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist and every christmas there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year the winner getting a lot of money eager to save his home and his aging dying grandfather nello willingly decides to become an artist asking aloise to pose for him one night the two travel to a circus where they have their fortune told one of the film's most delightful scenes that great happiness is destined for them she gives the kids a ring whom nello places on aloise's hand afterwards the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers unfortunately things are not all ladeedah' in this tale aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again bad enough that they can't see each other although we know nello and aloise don't we but that's only the start of nello's troubles aloise's farm is burned down and nello is wrongfully accused by the landord of his cottage for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise this decreases nello's reputation around the town save aloise and her parents and a kindly miller william who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies and he has to pay for his funeral but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home for not paying his rental permanetly this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold freezing wind worst of all the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time the portrait of the princess' fails to win the prize at the festival now nello and patrasche are really depressed and close to freezing to death will nello be able to find any happiness in his life will patrasche save the day will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise a dog of flanders is a delightful heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages even older ones who consider themselves too sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grownups too there have been other movies of this ilk boy and dog and while this one falls into that category it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself move over or rather roll over old yeller this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight the cinematography courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful and really adds to the powerful drama of the film it also gives a feel of being in flanders the whole film was respectably shot in flanders the music from richard friedman is also remarkable an evocative poignant score that recaptures music from the th century the opening song over the credits is very beautiful i hope the soundtrack is available and there's a brief excerpt of cheer up charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory sung by aloise to nello in another delightful scene the cast is firstrate jesse james and jeremy james kissner who play nello are some of the most endearing adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life so are the girls who play aloise madyline sweeten as the younger and farren monet as the older not that they are the only good stars however jack warden is ideal as jehan eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming touching ones also bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william he's another one of my favorite characters in the film but jon voight as i mentioned before is the perfect choice for michel he brings a mysterious yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he can win the contest but what makes this film fun to watch is how welldefined the characters are and the pace of the story best of all it has a happy ending though i will not give it away sorry is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters for the first time since the beginning of there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff such as bigbudget special effects commercial rock soundtracks or any of that stuff this one relies on telling a fully characteroriented story with just the right amount of heart humor and drama that to me is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful eleanor o'sullivan of the home news tribune' noticed this and was kind and generous enough to welcome it for want of a better word a glow surrounds a dog of flanders its heart is in the right place and it engages you you can guess where the film is going because this is welltraveled territory but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner an oftentold story is well worth a revisit ' in addition there were a couple of other enthusiasts such as chicagosun times and the washington post you should read their reviews they're really positive other critics however were not so kind stephen holden of the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing he found the film to be a sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr voight's character as hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda ' in addition entertainment weekly' slamdunked the film condemning it as the worst family film of the year ' there have been so many other bad reviews like this too my suggestion disregard the critics they just have a big problem with touching family films and one should never pay attention to them this dog of flanders may only be a little family' movie it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic but then again no other film has been since then but that is not a bad thing in and of itself this is a story that is sure to warm your heart and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders it is also one of the better family films around this year none of the other films i have seen this year though they were good have been so lowkey and touching if you're looking for familystyle entertainment look no further than this charming boyanddog yarn go see it while you still can for as i mentioned it might not be a big bowwow at the box office for a long time see it while you can there is really no need to compare a multimillion dollar blockbuster such as star wars episode i the phantom menace or tarzan or even the iron giant with a tender sweet little family movie",
                "a big surprise to me the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues john belushi is such a dumb idea i really had no hope they replaced him just fine not with john goodman he didn't do much of anything but with the brilliant actor joe morton who can really sing the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant who's ten this was another of my fears for the film but he's a really good dancer and plays a mean harmonica although he may have been dubbed things that intellectually had bothered me before like no mission from god everyone being richer it not being filmed in chicago gave me no problems at all i'm quite pleased that there were less car pileups because they meant less music and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing there's a few early crashes and then one huge pileup but after that it all stops it's just the music one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him but there's no problems with this the music is all as good as ever tons of great musicians showing up with the exception of johnny lang who can't sing all the musicians do a great job the only real problems i had was the special effects these were superfluous and a waste of money since the film isn't doing very well they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel which i want to see the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide http www geocities comhollywoodacademy remove no spam to reply drive carefully but recklessly mama child's toy the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise peter o'toole",

                "showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curryspiced tabasco sauce a dish not to everyone's taste but certainly a wellcrafted movie possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the characters' future so there was no need to film it there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there but eszterhas found ways to get it all onscreen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent characters we have shows for the eyes and the ears plotlines that play on several levels we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable and we have a story of an innocent who may not be so innocent who's trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slips into behaving the way those around her do but recovers with a flourish and quits a winner in this sense the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven who's not known for treating his characters well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in a positive way and we're left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movies but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative prerelease publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in and in the last quartercentury has pushed farther and farther experimenting with the sociallyacceptable limits to moviemaking his most recent three movies robocop total recall and basic instinct have been a progression of backdoor access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives and now he's exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating although his original version is available on video many reviewers have taken the politicallycorrect stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common and why such an environment should exist it's about the scum who use other people as powertrip toys and the need to escape their power it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment an nc movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been a good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator if anything it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls and in an awful lot of vegas shows an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity showgirls deglamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness nomi is played in a very good performance by elizabeth berkley who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope desperate to live a life better than the one she's known she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker trying to be something better than she seems destined to be when nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be gina rivera plays molly a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi providing her with what may be the one solid positive relationship in nomi's entire life molly is the one who makes the difference and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision gina gershon plays cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch a fading talent made bitter by selfawareness her character is very well drawn and performed in a major scene in a hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence passes the torch to nomi the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe molly is an honest hardworking person who means well and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality cristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a cooperating part of the system exchanging selfrespect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas nomi believes she can make it without selling herself succumbs to a degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and doesn't need las vegas or its brand of stardom the male parts in this movie are simply props they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs camouflaged as a nice guy glenn plummer plays a dancer who's working as a bellboy and provides a bit of alternate perspective plummer's character is the only one in the movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art but even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation plummer's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie some of jost vacano's cinematography is fantastic and one particular delineation of nomi's character alteration a nodialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting is utterly terrifying this movie is rated nc due to language sexual situations full frontal nudity violence and probably the costuming as well i don't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in moviemaking but don't go see it if you're not in a tough mood the only person it's possible to like in this movie ends up in an i c u on life support and there is probably not one character in this movie you'd enjoy meeting in person",

course has sworn off the likes of boys but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger complicating matters cameron's dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides to use a wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also has his sights set on bianca as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey as you can see things i hate about you includes a huge number of characters some of which i haven't even mentioned such as kat's shakespeareobsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and bianca's materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union at a short but wellused running time of minutes all of the characters are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated as caricatures another flaw of she's all that where the bad guys and gals ran around constantly saying you're vapor since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained aside from a good screenplay it's the performances that can make or break a movie and director junger has really hit the jackpot aside from joseph gordonlevitt rd rock from the sun who gives his strongest performance to date here none of the actors are that wellknown but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings as the main character of kat julia stiles last seen in the miniseries the 's is marvelous and always believable and certainly has a bright future ahead of her even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hardedged it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath and i completely admired her individuality no one i think could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does heath ledger as the infamous badboy of the town injects much life into patrick and has a lot of chemistry with stiles one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith is able to turn bianca into a person with multidimensions even though she is accurately selfcentered at the onset in one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she has one offbeat element of the film and a source of some hearty laughs is the way that the school's staff act which is strikingly unformal allison janney as the guidance counselor ms perky who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel is comic dynamite as is daryl chill mitchell as the english teacher who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and at one point sends kat to the office because for once she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning most of it actually works especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters in one very funny scene chastity asks i know people can be overwhelmed and they can be underwhelmed but can people just be whelmed at another point bianca and kat's father a standout larry miller who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion before she leaves she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant things i hate about you once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the 's it also helps that the movie has a perfectlyassembled soundtrack mixing indierock with new wave 's songs and with thank goodness no rap by the film's end it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca kat and her father and a flawlesslyacted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class this is where the title comes from luckily i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about things i hate about you but the positive aspects of the film far outnumber ten",

                "on rewatching italian writerdirector dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his giallo murder mysteries while it's certainly not perfect repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal anthony franciosa where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book tenebrae with the police on his back for leads he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa he brings grace charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding reallife horror around him the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral ambivalent shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business tenebrae is perhaps the most multilayered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep redprofondo rosso the fulllength italian language version and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes needless to say for argento fans there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria instead tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek clinical chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment so tenebrae has much to recommend it no question still constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films but damnit it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated by the way if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which properly handled could have proved ingenious we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who we later discover is none other than the author peter neal he is insane apparently the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife he is finally revealed to us as this second killer in the film's bloody climax but argento muffs the twist both technically and narratively you see we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house but thanks to poor editing its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway bad cutting puts the timing way out in other words he's almost in two places at once during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have selfinflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant the injury he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock thus the revelation of the hero as a killer and antihero in the final scenes may still prove shocking but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled helpfully in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along but there too is a problem as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies for instance a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike we would assume the rider is the same boy but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too that's careless filmmaking pure and simple why you may ask do i go on about the story's flaws because when it comes to visuals and set pieces argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where almost unbelievably it jumps a high fence and chases her across town finally as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair it's an absolutely masterful sequence tense and exciting and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating too often it seems argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts mind you if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli it's a stylish greatlooking and quirky film despite the problem narrative a shame because it doesn't have to be that way take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome where with the aid of cowriter franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache proof that he can do it if he tries",

                "john sayles' men with guns is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power the film takes place in an unnamed central american country where the men with guns are the rulers most of the country is divided into tiny segments some are controlled by guerrillas with guns some are controlled by army soldiers with guns and all the spaces inbetween are controlled by thieves bandits and terrorists all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness however like so many central american countries this one also features modernity there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization skyscrapers hospitals televisions highways etc but it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land or else they are simply ignorant of it the film's main character dr fuentes federico luppi falls into the latter category one of his patients an army general describes him as the most educated man he has ever met and also the most naive fuentes is a true liberal a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians with government assistance he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate this program was to be his legacy and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea however when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot g s he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned as he travels deeper into the forest going from village to village the story is always the same the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers usually for helping the other when dr fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors she replies simply because they had guns and we didn't rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power dr fuentes picks up several companions during his journey all of whom are characterized by their loss first there is a young boy named conejo dan rivera gonz lez who has neither a mother nor a father next fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo dami n delgado who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities through his ordeal in the army domingo has lost most of his selfrespect and defines himself only by his pistol along the way the group also picks up padre portillo dami n alc zar a priest who has lost his faith as domingo is running from the army so is portillo he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer and ran away from the village in which he was preaching last the group takes on a mute girl named graciela tania cruz who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her sayles two major strengths as a director characters and setting are abundantly evident in men with guns like many of his films sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room but a longerthannecessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor he creates fascinating complex characters especially dr fuentes and domingo their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film's overarching theme of violence as power domingo's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes' belief that the revolver is unloaded at first it is but later is isn't the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself sayles knows how to bring a location to life whether it be an early twentiethcentury coal mining town in matewan or a contemporary texasmexico bordertown in lone star sayles is not a particularly inventive director he likes to let his actors do most of the work but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak gattaca successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico using all latin american actors and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border it would not be a stretch to say that men with guns is a depressing film in fact the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure in addition to loss the main characters are also failures at something whether that be dr fuentes failure to change anything through medicine or padre portillo's inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being nevertheless it is bleak material sayles has chosen and he deals with it accordingly the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope even in a world where as one character puts it nobody refuses the men with guns",

cellist and when it all begins both are considered child prodigies but hilary is seen as the better of the two jackie a bit jealous works and works at her playing skills and soon the tables are turned when they both hit adulthood hilary strives for a comeback while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world but instead of fame captures the heart of a hapless joyful conductor kiffer finzi david morissey in a semistarmaking turn they marry after a short courtship and move to a lovely country house making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life when she plays she has the eyes of the world but when she stops she's alone she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist daniel barenboim james frain in hopes that she may overcloud her sister but she eventually begins to lose it and runs away to hilary's country home where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure it's all terribly melodramtic as you can see and by the time jackie has contracted ms in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semismiliar shine in technical and emotional devastation it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister which i might add is perfectly realized their relationship is the most downtoearth complex entity of the year they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world but they're also completely jealous of one another when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i've ever seen in a film only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man and the whole time their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease or any combination of the three my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in beloved sure she's good but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around slurs her words together and acts like a three year old inside a year old's body hell i could play that if i had a pair of breasts in that same exact movie though is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane her brothers run off never to be seen again and her mother's lover is scared off she has to actually deal with real emotions something much harder than mere stumbling about but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons if you don't believe me look at jack nicholson's performance in as good as it gets great performance but easy job this isn't so for watson though because her insanity comes from real emotions not just a plot point and thanks to the opening sequence where we see her and hilary as kids we understand the motives behind all her actions and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life we've already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses rachel griffiths who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson's protagonist actually matches watson stepforstep because as watson grows insane and demands unspeakable things from her griffiths holds her own and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her griffiths an otherwise unknown actress and watson being famous from breaking the waves and the boxer is absolutely brilliant just as absolutely brilliant as watson is and if the academy and all the other critics groups who've already deemed watson's performance the best of the year glance over hers because she's the one who doesn't get to go insane read she gets the boring role then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me after all griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real the tom cruise role in rainman the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman she does and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year it's griffiths together the two actresses work extremely well though and both have to go through deep emotional hell the likes of which haven't been seen this year if it hadn't been for an otherwise nottotallygreat final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety i'd say this is one of the top ten best films of the year it's so close to perfection in its structure its treatment of its subject and its beautiful technical specifications cinematography nomination without a shred of doubt in my mind and maybe film editing that it's nearly a shame that it's not the flawless gem that it should be but hey as it is i can hardly complain",
                "melvin van peebles' sweet sweetback's baadasssss song was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before in style content and how it was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was a cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees with its subject matter van peebles a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely by himself because no studio would dare fund such a film he was forced to raise all the money himself the movie ended up costing about part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby van peebles cut costs by hiring nonunion labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself he wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film as well as starred in the central role he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck for instance when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded xrating van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed a little marketing scheme he coined the phrases rated x by an allwhite jury which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film he also printed the phrase on teeshirts which he had no problem selling the storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple it takes place in los angeles and van peebles stars as the title character a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel and makes money by doing what he does best having sex one day he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politicallycharged case involving murder however on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mumu hubert scales who they proceed to beat viciously acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l a the ghettos alleys and backstreet whorehouses that other films had always overlooked van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored at the beginning of sweet sweetback he offers this epigraph which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented but a hymn from the mouth of reality van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality not of exaggeration of course with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black innercity life as well as films by spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback doesn't seem all that revolutionary it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made at that time sweet sweetback was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it distributors were petrified of a film that in van peebles' words gave the black audience a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking ass of course once it caught on it caught on big sweet sweetback is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft and the mack because those were financed by big hollywood studios sweet sweetback is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers however even if when viewed from an africanamerican perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without its controversies when it was first released an article was published in ebony magazine denouncing the film while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film he has no political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs but in personal and selfish motives still others point to the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm nevertheless a movie like sweet sweetback cannot be made without conflicting points of view it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance but because it put frontandcenter black issues that had never been dealt with before until that point american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain and with the exception of sidney poitier all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites the fact that sweet sweetback was a movie by black about blacks was something new in the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors as simply the black community van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before it when the movie first opened he saw it in a theater next to an older woman near the end of the film when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying to herself oh lord let him die don't let them kill him let him die on his own it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any africanamerican in a movie who rebelled against white authority that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape and of course sweetback does escape and the screen fills with the message watch out a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues beyond the political aspects sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture which van peebles always intended it to be he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced a film that although dated now was technically fantastic at the time he shot in rough documentarylike fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him he makes good use of older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment watching sweet sweetback more than twentyfive years after its initial release one realizes that it still has bite arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected in this film but there is more to the film than its racial aspect the legacy of sweet sweetback's baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the africanamerican perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him",

                "robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible godgiven gifts but are able to act like ordinary people in the natural he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined to be the best there ever was but still acted like a humble farm boy in butch cassidy and the sundance kid he was the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly goodlooking charmer even in indecent proposal where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting a tale of lost love in his latest film the horse whisperer based on the bestselling novel by nicholas evans redford again plays such a character redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie i suppose the character of tom booker a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses was just too good to pass up despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses a magazine article coins the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas a new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson was recently in a horrible accident the accident which is filmed with gutwrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses an eighteenwheeler kills grace's friend severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse pilgrim and causes grace to lose part of her right leg annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed as well which leads her to booker at first she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that doesn't work instead she packs up grace and pilgrim leaves her husband robert sam neill behind and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sisterinlaw diane dianne wiest in many ways the film is like a journey both literally and symbolically the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs country in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the characters arrive in the wideopen spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate annie's controlling nature begins to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed a river runs through it six years ago in many ways the horse whisperer comes from the same poetic vein as river and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less cameratime on the grass and mountains but then that would ruin the magic much of the film's photography is truly elegant and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land to further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killers platoon cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film which takes place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filters and a more squarish aspect ratio when the action shifts to montana richardson switches to softfocus and natural lighting and the screen widens to a aspect ratio in terms of the story itself the horse whisperer gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's a brief encounter and clint eastwood's adaptation of robert james waller's the bridges of madison county richard lagravenese coscreenwriter here also adapted bridges although the horse whisperer has a strong romantic sensibility i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief heartsweeping affair but there rarely is in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddyduddy husband falls to sam neill he plays the character as a decent hardworking man who is a good husband and father his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be a normal fairly uninspiring man there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all while robert looks somewhat frumpy and outofplace in a baseball cap as they enter the pen booker assuredly swings over the fence while robert hesitates then opens the gate and in a goofy moment forgets to close it behind him it's a small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it the best scenes in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse although booker's horsetraining methods are mythical and unrealistic the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true at some point i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nevertheless redford is obviously a romantic at heart and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film there are no dramatic sex scenes but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slowdancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moments like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission",
                "synopsis captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of the ba'ku from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro the enterprise crew in the meantime experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld lt worf grows a pimple data sings opera pieces picard scores with a ba'ku chick riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts comments star trek the next generation was a hugely successful sequel tv series to star trek a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the s even though it still enjoyed high ratings star trek the next generation ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original star trek 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise star trek insurrection is the ninth star trek movie and the third to focus on the star trek the next generation crew star trek insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans such as myself would rate somewhere between okay and good after star trek v the final frontier a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant star trek voyager tv series star trek fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies most people reading this probably haven't followed star trek anyway so a comparison would seem tedious at best let me thus make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system star trek insurrection is not as good as the previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv the voyage home star trek ii the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie okay let's move to the movie itself star trek insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise humanity's exploration and colonization of space with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners this combination works well more often than it fails but when it does fail the humor really seems cheesy much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times star trek insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld forget the actors and special effects the beautiful setting of this movie with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys steals the show this tranquility however is broken by data an android who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies the son'a it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young healthy state the enterprise crew led by captain picard investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youthrestoring properties sound pretty heavy it is though this plot anything but unique and groundbreaking is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor when going after data for instance picard sings an opera piece with him this is supposed to be cute and humorous in a much more funny sequence work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld a pimple which his crewmates try as they might cannot avoid looking at the acting in star trek insurrection is for the most part pretty good since they've been playing these characters for years those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard and delivers a moral speech picard's trademark with his usual aplomb brent spiner another fine actor plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film though the old androidwishingtobehuman motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good despite many other critics' negative opinions f murray abraham the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus plays the major villain ru'afro well enough ru'afro reminds me somewhat of the baron harkonnen in the film version of dune like the baron ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after it is stretched and stapled by servants in one particularly memorable scene ru'afro becomes very agitated and his facial skin splits open and bleeds ru'afro is no khan from star trek iithe best trek villain everbut he is much better than the forgettable dr soran from star trek generations okay i promise no more comparisons donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman anij who picard falls in love with murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance this is the type of woman whom picard for those who know the character well would be enchanted with in fact the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down an ability which she shares with picard becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie for as good as the actors and setting were star trek insurrection's special effects were surprisingly disappointing they proved adequate sometimes barely for a s mainstream science fiction film but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars the phantom menace a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships in particular seemed trite and unsuspenseful and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite the new enterprise itself only seen in this film and its predecessor remains largely unexplored though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain despite star trek insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects i enjoyed the film it maintains roddenberry's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors particularly star trek first contact though don't get me wrong the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully i'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general rated pg i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience young or old",

                "apparently director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film american history x i don't know the details of the fight but it seems that he is not happy with the final product and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether i've heard about this kind of thing happening before and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce as it is i found american history x to be an extremely good film not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism but because of a powerful charismatic performance from edward norton it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear but here he is now starring in his own film and making himself a star norton is one of those performers who becomes his character and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year he plays a young man named derek vinyard a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother danny edward furlong mother beverly d'angelo and sister davin jennifer lien the film opens with a flashback in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car we find out that this lands him in prison and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny in the presenttime of the film danny is in high school and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother much of the film is told in flashback and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy when derek is released having served three years in prison he finds that his brother is now a fullblown skinhead derek however has given up the violence and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid thoughtless people they are intelligent and articulate and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach but kaye has found the right note for his material because american history x is a mainstream film there has to be a redemption phase for our main character some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic i partially disagree with this because although i do not advocate racism in any way it's interesting the way kaye presents derek he is a loud obnoxious man but he's also very smart the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up of course it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest in addition to getting the look just right he's perfect for this role derek requires intelligence depth and a whole lot of shouting and norton does it all with ease even when he's at his meanest derek has a likable quality to him and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school avery brooks becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny the other performances are all terrific with standouts from furlong d'angelo and lien visually the film is very powerful kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices and most of them work nicely lots of slowmotion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere but like a lot of movies lately american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes although the climactic scene is very moving the picture ends with a pretentious preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point it felt like a slap in the face to be handfed a theme in such a simplistic way it makes me wonder what exactly tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film perhaps this last scene was the problem it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good in a time when so many movies are timid and weak american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way",
                "david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director with his distinctive more often than not ingenious dialogue and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible some of them tend to be thickly layered deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message or sometimes even a concealed storyline and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors it is still a brilliantly complex consistently riveting motion picture about honor about sacrifice and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right oh and it's rated g incidentally this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work namely a play by terrence rattigan set in the th century he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow a rich aging man who finds out that his year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a shilling postal note did you do it he asks his boy no father i didn't ronnie answers that's enough for arthur who with his oldest daughter rebecca pidgeon immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case to court they enlist the help of sir robert morton a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task it all seems fairly frivolous and no matter how you look at it the winslow case is not the trial of the century but arthur is determined to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that soon enough sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings so do we all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue but his style is still fairly apparent the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense but this is not mamet's norm and it's refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks gangsters as con men wonderful as those films were nigel hawthorne's performance is nearly flawless his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game we pity the man but we also like him rebecca pidgeon david mamet's wife who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur's oldest daughter a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women's suffrage movement the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one be honest did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill if you wanted to but didn't this is a movie for you it is the epitome of subtlety it's powerful without being too emotional sad without even trying to be depressing david mamet can churn out some great scripts but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too he is almost a national treasure his films deserve their own genre eugene novikov",

                "only a year after the initial release of scream the horror sendup from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre the inevitable sequel scream has arrived in our theaters while the tongueincheek parodic element is still noticeable in this film it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story the first film while often violent and gruesome was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant the premise of scream is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called stab based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers courtney cox about the events in scream is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy its conclusion in which a bleeding wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt is more surreal and disturbing than anything else the satire in scream thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general although resident horror film geek randy jamie kennedy is back with fresh dialogue about sequels and interestingly enough how they are usually inferior to their predecessors the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well everything from friends and saved by the bell to showgirls and terminator is referenced here horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning and there aren't any wes carpenter jokes this time more importantly this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from scream in fact the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show understandably scream does not go so far as to actually blame the movies but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted couple that with the fact that several of the characters most notably the lead character sidney prescott neve campbell are fairly welldeveloped and that there are some genuine moments of spinechilling suspense and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered and in one case a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner while i have not seen any of his other work it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated slasher film director as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing unfortunately scream occasionally reverts to the timehonored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window for example several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that s he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction as for the question of whether or not scream is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor well it's hard to say i gave the first scream stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a lighthearted sendup scream bounces all over the place stylistically but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment i'm not sure which is the better movie but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing sequels however much randy might argue do not necessarily suck",

                "countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally luckily movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation otherwise small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer in case of star wars science fiction epic by george lucas the consequences would be even more severe because that film is very special for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of fans in any case objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best if not the best film of all times those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold objective standards in reviewing this film like so many previous reviewers i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since perhaps it was childlike fascination with until then unimaginable wonders that happened long time ago in a galaxy far away or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before anyway watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life and it was also unmatched for many years to come because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic star wars wasn't just important movie for me or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema until than american motion picture industry was in a limbo social turmoil in s practically destroyed the old hollywood and new authors filled the void mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious personal or artsy movies as a result audience traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success of the movie later backed by supplement industry of toys books comics role playing games and other merchandise slowly began to change the face of hollywood serious adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion and were replaced by industrial products of blockbuster philosophy one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre until science fiction movies were mostly in bproduction domain in late s bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore thanks to the great success of a space odyssey but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production mostly dark dystopic movies however in star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies even among the audience that usually doesn't like it as a result seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early s after that science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment ironically the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of new hollywood generation of young movie authors who made artsy and personal films in early s george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx and nostalgic drama american graffiti both movies were considered personal in its time despite latter one becoming very popular in a sense star wars is an also very personal film and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it not for it but unlike many personal movies of the era its personality was in line with the wishes of the general audience the plot set a long time ago in a galaxy far away begins in a time of civil war the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic in order to quash any opposition the empire had built death star superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets the information about death star acquired by rebel intelligence is being transported by princess leia organa carrie fisher when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots cpo anthony daniels and rd kenny baker those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker mark hamill young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot his adventure begins when rd escapes because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi alec guiness old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force after some hesitation luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess while the old man would teach him the ways of the force their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew critics who don't like the movie especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of new hollywood are prone to point the lack of originality on the surface they might be right lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood westerns wwii aviation movies old sf cliffhanger serials of the s and s yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress on the other hand those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further into collective subconscious of western civilisation hinted by some mild tolkien references the others would find the author's element within the story star wars could be seen as an anti establishment film young longhaired easy going natureloving heroes are fighting against old uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes even out of its historical or social context star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art george lucas' direction is very good with the clever editing and a wellpaced segments between action and dramatic buildup characters are welldrawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster we have a comingofage hero damselindistress somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief in form of two nonhuman characters some of the actors are very good alec guiness in his most famous role to date james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form unfortunately the same can't be said for the main leads among the main trio of mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character threedimensional enough to launch his further acting career the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology often comparisons with space odyssey another groundbreaking sf film were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas' superiority over kubrick however the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decades although special edition did improve them significantly yet they aren't the most remembered trademark of the movie that honour should definitely go to the oscar winning soundtrack by john williams whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release yet even if they are immune to the george lucas' magic they should watch this film nevertheless perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture",

it was going to be you too can believe wood sprites can fly finally i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say there's a lot of flying going on in this film as our first host steve martin tells us the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in grossing somewhere close to in its original month of release subsequent rereleases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved and rightfully deserved to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before six stories high in an exclusive four month engagement from january st to april th fantasia can be seen at many imax theaters across the us after the engagement is over the film will be shown at regular theaters is the format effective for the film with a few exceptions yes the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil black batlike triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts eventually shafts of light from above help drive away the evil batlike things and peace returns to the butterfly things though this segment isn't very story driven some of the images are very visually strong especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things who are all outlined in blood red colors begin to overtake the skies the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's the pines of rome in this segment some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack he is finally saved by another liberating shaft of light and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the oceans of clouds again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whales are involved reportedly the whales as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences are shown as actual size the cgi whales look incredibly lifelike except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least of the eight segments is set to george gershwin's rhapsody in blue this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer an outofwork sad sack that dreams of having a job a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife i won't go into how everything works out but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending unfortunately the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's piano concerto no and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's the steadfast tin soldier a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a windup clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jackinthebox jester the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina little does the jester know the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl although the ending has been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short some children may find the jester to be a little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set to camille saintsaens the carnival of the animals this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yoyo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original fantasia and it's the one that people remember most the sorcerer's apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film considering it was shot full frame and exhibits large amounts of grain there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many plus screen theaters segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's pomp and circumstance march no and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character donald duck stars as an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn't make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tearjerkers foisted on audiences these days powerful stuff segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last set to igor stravinsky's the firebird an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in a stunning spectacle the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path including everything that the sprite has worked to create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film the host segments are largely no pun intended throwaways although steve martin's clip is pretty funny be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment comes from of all people bette midler who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board pieces like flight of the bumblebee a take on the four horsemen set to wagner's ride of the valkyries and a strange segment prepared in the 's by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments for fans of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia is a perfect way to spend the afternoon the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material as i mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whalestriangle thingssprites can fly g",
                "disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure mulan while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults fa mulan mingna wen singing lea salonga wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family it's just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker miriam margoyles mulan would prefer speaking her mind but there is trouble on the horizon the evil huns led by shanyu miguel ferrer are invading china the emperor pat morita has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army the only male in mulan's family is her father fa zhou soontek oh who old and with a bad leg honorably accepts his fate mulan on the other hand decides to save her father's life by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield mulan under the assumed name of ping appears at camp where she along with the other bumbling recruits yao harvey fierstein chienpo jerry tondo and ling gedde watanabe are trained in the art of war by captain shang b d wong singing donny osmond but she's not alone in her tasks in typical disney fashion she has three animal companions her horse khan a lucky cricket crickey and a pintsized guardian dragon called mushu eddie murphy much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story sure some occasional comic relief is welcome particularly in a film geared for the younger set but mulan overdoes it the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good but schizophrenic experience but that commentary aside this is a very well made film which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable the animation is on par with some of disney's best the story itself is interesting and the action scenes are aweinspiring the musical score to the film is enjoyable though as has been the case with disney's recent work the songs are mostly forgettable at least we're only subjected to four of them this time around mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date most of the killing is offscreen and it's all highly depersonalized there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom there's nothing graphic and the film resides snugly inside a g rating children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor ax the compulsory songs and remove the obligatory and somewhat unrealistic romance they could have had a classic on their hands instead they merely deliver a very good time at the movies",
                "scream has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well during a filmclass discussion windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are and why sequels never live up to the originals a few rare exceptions are noted but they left out one scream 's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america a sequel was unavoidable but luckily the reteaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment in fact at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream i would say that scream might even be the better film sidney prescott neve campbell the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro ca in the original scream is now two years older and off to college majoring in theater meanwhile tv journalist gale weathers courtney cox who covered the murders in the first film has since written a book about the dreadful events a book titled stab which has been developed into a major motion picture as scream opens a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of stab and before long a young couple are butchered to death unnoticed in the midst of hysteria this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown copycat sets out to repeat what's been done and finish what hasn't of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film and yes movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as heshe goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds but this is a sequel and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script which will easily leave you satisfied as much as the film condemns the use of cliches it is riddled with them but it is done so effectively and with skillful direction by craven that you're not bound to complain i will note however that the whodunit did wind up being the first person i suspected but believe me i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie all the actors outdo themselves here we're not talking oscar performances but cambell cox david arquette as dewey riley and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing the characters remain true to their roots and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years we can see how the events in the first film has affected them but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place the nice thing about scream is that it doesn't seem offkilter from it's predecessor it's a natural smooth and believable as far as horror films go transition from film to film we skip two years but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book long chapters eh than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels scream 's entire plot structure correlates completely with the first making for immediate fondness and absorption as i said before scream easily lives up to if not surpassing it's precursor the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream is because it was the first this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's soughtafter qualities if ever a film followed it's original so well it would be scream and it makes this a definite mustsee for all those unbridled scream fans out there scream fits snugly alongside scream and will hopefully receive as many high remarks it would top off the series quite well if it weren't for the fact that two movies don't really make a series it's unlikely to assume that a scream won't appear in the next few years but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horrortrilogy let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work like they say don't mess with perfection but when a moneymaking smashhit is almost guaranteed who's gonna listen",

                "in october of the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u spy plane flyovers of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles miles from the us president john kennedy bruce greenwood and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in thirteen days one of the highlights to come out of madefortv movies was a entry called missiles of october that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown that teleplay starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in now a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again the last time was for the taught spy thriller no way out to reenact the events of that most dangerous time in america's and the world's history taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p o'donnell costner donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event once again as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning he deals with the usual family crises and problems meanwhile a u spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment suddenly ken's routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat where thirteen days differs most from missiles of october is as expected in the scope of the project there is a big difference budgetwise between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen it shows as the makers of thirteen days craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation the cast a true ensemble is led surprisingly by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe but he knows that if the crisis comes to a head his family will be no more the meat of thirteen days is in the big picture not the microcosm of family though this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels the story does not just cover the faceoff between the world's two most powerful countries it also depicts the animosity between the president and the militarycia the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the armynavyair force want to flex their might and invade cuba while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america's dignity and world leadership intact while the internal battle for power rages in the white house with air force chief curtis lemay kevin conway advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter the tension is palpable the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an antiaircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent instead he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president costner as ken o'donnell is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor costner plays o'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast too standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un adlai stevenson who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy using old style video footage to good effect dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara kevin conway gives his general lemay the right bomb them to hell attitude also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who with his wingman takes on the dangerous mission of a lowlevel photo recon into the heart of cuba bravely challenging kenny o'donnell's admonition don' get shot tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing it's an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right the special fx of the u sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader

                "in the stock market crashed and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses wall street lucked out in its timing the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had and though its killorbekilled approach to business was exaggerated that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reaganera businessman stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs evil tale relayed in the fastpaced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange critics and audiences lauded wall street elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures obvious sentiments and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen stone goes for broke in every scene the same could be said for nearly all of his works this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity rather than explore what these situations are really like i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative as they are presented in boiler room rather than laughably over the top these guys are salesmen after all not televised judges more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street the only possible solution i can muster is its release date and not just the timeliness of the greed is good subject matter the film was plumped down in the eighties a decade in which the onejoke comedy rose to an art form and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept low result movies in my mind the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies but bad music bad hair and bad clothes maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace boiler room is an equally welltimed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap they both feature a consequential fatherson relationship though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching and they are both concerned with the power of greed yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slipperysmooth heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street boiler room is a message movie as well though at least until the end doesn't shove it in our faces boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash as i said this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while not only do we want to be millionaires we want to watch other people become millionaires in our superjudgmental poweroriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything when you have money you have it all and seth giovanni ribisi wants it all the easy way he's a wellintentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm the kind that sells junk stock whereupon he meets others just like him ben affleck is cast as jim the company headhunter who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance affleck shouts curses and belittles his rookie employees just like baldwin minus the edge when alec played the scene he became the part spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are intellectual gangsters they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes we drink up this world along with seth and watch him become seduced by it just like we might be as in all cautionary tales boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness i know this story we all do but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy and that is how writer director ben younger tells it as a director of please excuse my french miseenscene younger has much to learn his style is sitcom bland but his writing isn't younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch his dialogue is like a junior david mamet despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phonepitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script the brokers hucksters counter every customer objection gently bullying them into buying stock these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one with the exception of affleck's brief appearances the performances are truly exceptional ribisi who has the edgy looks of a character actor is extremely potent here working his pale angular face and eerie plaintive stare for all their worth he conveys childlike vulnerability his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren't going his way in some scenes and in others he's ferociously cut throat the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father authoritatively played by ron rifkin boiler room thankfully avoids wall streetlike histrionics in the salespitch sequences the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys those ploys are taught to seth by chris vin diesel a kind broker who alternates between seth's friend and his mentor diesl shines in his minor role this week i saw the scifi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 's and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 's nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can't have nia long as the firm's secretary a lone black women amongst many white men is ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets but develops into something more interesting the two make an oddly likeable couple long is smart and brash and ribisi is charmingly aloof at one point he says to her i'm just lookin' for some chocolate love it's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous childlike way it becomes sweetly endearing unfortunately towards the end the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy there is much crying hugging and sorrowful stares this is okay when taken in small doses but younger's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boohoo moments one following the other a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims it's not a bad idea but the execution is lacking with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message that message being greed is bad yes it's patently obvious but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven't seen much of in the movies the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners boiler room offers neither extreme it gives us what is in between and for that i am thankful",

                "it is simply amazing how the green mile developed in its three hour running time based on the stephen king series of the same title the film starts out painfully slow with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue however as the plot begins to progress the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction frank darabont who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in the shawshank redemption this time follows the perspective of a prison guard paul edgecomb tom hanks through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner the green mile is successful in creating sympathy for kindhearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb the ensemble acting in the film is perfect hanks david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson sam rockwell and michael duncan hutchinson playing percy wetmore a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie every time he appears on the screen the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks rockwell an independent film veteran plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened childlike behemoth very similar to lennie small in of mice and men his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause his pain creates pain for the viewer however it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at the jerry springer show the scene containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief as the film flashes back to graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is the scene is neither sad nor convincing greene is not even given a final word like some of the other characters and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile however as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters such as coffey and eduard delacroix michael jeter as well as the five prison guards the film becomes more interesting the speed in the green mile is perfect if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character the green mile is so good following the rough beginning that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing if you survive the first third of the green mile sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment",

                "a man is not a man without eight taels of gold starring sammo hung sylvia chang directed by mabel cheung written by cheung and alex law cinematography by bill wong eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful but both are good enough and along the way there is one perfect scene which is one more than you find in most films slim played by portly sammo hung better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york when the movie opens we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver he does not seem particularly out of place in fact he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years spending most of his life savings in the process and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water as he realizes that you can never go home he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters cheap sunglasses and lobsters which have to be large to prove they're american the tokens of his success he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch because without eight taels of gold a man is not a man my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb he loses most of this stuffexcept the goldwhen his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride so to speak on a raft along the river which runs past his parents' village when he arrives unannounced he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father all of this has the makings of a routine comedy and the movie has its amusing moments as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming and they all give him birds so by evening's end he is surrounded by turkeys ducks geese and other sundry fowl but eight taels is not a comedyit is a sad sweet story about the choices people make and how they are sometimes irreparable director mabel cheung an autumn's tale the soong sisters sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the worldwhat it is like to no longer have a place to call home slim does not belong in china nor does he belong in america where he can barely speak the language seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village we come to know the world slim left behind and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time and wishes it felt more like home the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed i being one was sympathetic on his way to his parent's village slim hooks up with jenny sylvia chang whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed oddsandends which is what he continues to call her although she is now a mature professional attractive woman to be married in the spring to an americanchinese man slim and oddsandends fall for each other that's predictable the manner in which their non romance is played out is not the emotions involved are adult and complex and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma it's typical for instance that the fianc in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover but here the fianc is a decent ordinary guy and although slim would like to feel anger he cannot the fianc has done nothing wrong the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions take your pick eight taels has its share of flaws the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak but it compensates with insight when oddsandends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco she notes resignedly it's all the same wherever we go we'll be in chinatown and her straightforward statement expresses much there is insight too in the understanding of the consequences of slim and oddsandends' decisions he to move to america she to marry a chineseamerican both their choices were perhaps born of impatience perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greenerand it turns out that both choices were wrong but they cannot undo them they must live with what they have done such is life the movie is tender toward these people but it offers no false comforts everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene which is the culmination of the love story slim and oddsandends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly with the muted poppop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss the exchange that follows and what slim then does is poignant and perfect with clarity and understatement we see two people's lives their heartbreaks and virtues summed up in a single moment yes the film is flawed but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies",
                "it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy made their feature film debut with blood simple a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge murder and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas it bears some resemblance storywise to the coens' recent fargo but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here blood simple is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end the premise of blood simple is really just a slight variation on the standard lovetrianglerevenge scheme sleazy bar owner julian marty dan hedaya hires a shifty private detective m emmet walsh to kill his wife abby frances mcdormand and her illicit lover ray john getz things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but upon collecting the money becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much but what ensues is a series of bloody and i do mean bloody confrontations each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes but we the audience are made privy to the big picture and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person this aspect of the story along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality one gets the sense that if guns and in one case shovels were not available some of these characters would claw each other to death are the most effective components of the film the coens might have done well to title the film fear and loathing in texas some have labeled blood simple as a modernday noir but while i am not an expert on either genre it seems more like a horror movie than anything else the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one relatively innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive that said blood simple is a very good horror movie the fear and suspense here are genuine the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun discharging it as it skitters across the floor or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film that said blood simple is not exactly flawless for one thing the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover or at least thought they did but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder and although they at least didn t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches they indulge in a prolonged deadguyseemstohavecomebacktolifebutthenwefindoutit'sonlyadream scene that had me rolling my eyes the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film blood simple is not quite the masterpiece of neonoir that many seem to think it is but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but nonexploitative manner i would firmly recommend it to all coenheads as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller",

                "capsule this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii life in a japanese prison camp to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste to more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law during world war ii of course the one goal was winning the war this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal when the japanese had captured prisoners they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output while the germans not known for their kindness in those days had a mortality rate among captured prisoners of war the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story perhaps for fear of offending the japanese there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai there were some lowbudget british exploitation films and that was about it then there were tv series a town like alice and tenko lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for years the dean of the chapel at princeton university the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad it turns out to be a grim joke one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves beating and torture are commonplace events men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable however unlike as in kwai the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital called by the prisoners the death house so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a raillaying machine this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies the japanese believe that the individual is nothing that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning conformity is purpose before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story if the british with one american by the way and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story it is neither it is a stirring and believable account of camp life the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow this serves a double purpose for cunningham it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat it also creates a distancing effect the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience i rate it a on the to scale and a on the to scale",
                "in tim burton's sleepy hollow' there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe burton's update on washington irving's classic tale of the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror writer andrew kevin walker seven' throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine as sleepy hollow' opens we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau who won an oscar in burton's ed wood' landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow who on a fateful carriage ride through the forest is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town constable ichabod crane johnny depp is sent in to investigate landlord baltus von tassel michael gambon explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods crane is not a man of great superstition and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie first and foremost sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film as with virtually all burton movies we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly the horseman fx are stylish and impressive particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors but why did i enjoy sleepy hollow' as much as i did although enjoyable it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right it was the light comic touch that burton applied the film has the sweetness of a candy apple usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane who is no longer a mildmannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities this is certainly not the only alteration that's been made as the film progresses it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together because for the audience it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved it's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive still we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention the costuming is exceptional and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout it's recognizable that the script was refined by awardwinning playwright tom stoppard the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent walken michael gough who appeared in burton's batman' films and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles i suppose the strengths behind sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio director burton constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy all of this is not to be taken seriously of course sleepy hollow' is a lavish frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children if you've got a decent head on your shoulders you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time",

                "dimension films scream 's distributor has asked press to say extremely little if anything about the film's twisty plot that's no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here but i will do my best to be vague now there's a first the first one was good but all the rest sucked said a cinematicallysavvy teen in last winter's wes craven thriller scream her statement referring to the films of the nightmare on elm street series but really putting down franchise overkill in general the comment certainly carries clout for every truly great sequel there appears to be a couple of duds making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas but like it or not along comes scream and believe it or not it's a doozy a slick sinister madly subversive good time at the movies as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions scream is definitely that rare movie thing a followup that can stand along side its original with pride it's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munchesque getups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro california those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives plucky heroine sidney prescott neve campbell is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college her pop culturewhiz pal randy meeks jamie kennedy has tagged along trash tabloid reporter gale weathers courteney cox has written a bestseller based on their ordeal the basis of which has been turned into a very bad movie called stab and dewey riley david arquette still suffering from wounds inflicted during scream has left his job as a police officer for a while life is tranquil at least for a while several sudden murders bring sidney randy gale and dewey together again but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings if these four people learned anything from the past it's to trust no one thus the possible victimpotential killer list includes said quartet as well as derek jerry o'connell sidney's new beau cici sara michelle gellar a chatty sorority gal joel duane martin gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her bloodsoaked past hallie elise neal sidney's sassy roommate debbie laurie metcalf a local reporter who gives gale some nottoofriendly competition and mickey timothy olyphant randy's good friend and fellow film student cotton weary liev schreiber the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder in scream also shows up on campus but why like the first scream craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang this time it's an extended sequence that finds an africanamerican couple jada pinkett and omar epps attending a sneak preview of stab making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat nonroles of blacks in slasher cinema before tragedy ensues at the screening the moviewithinamovie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments including a scene from stab which turns scream's nowfamous drew barrymore prologue on its ear b hang up the phone and star his a pinkett yells at the screen it's funny creepy stuff i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phoneassault of the killer on randy dewey and gale in broad daylight it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters there are other superb set pieces but explaining them risks ruining their effect there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count it's something of a tradein the new characters are too large in number to be as fullydeveloped as the original scream gang but this movie packs in knowing performances especially by kennedy and cox and more death for your dollar it can be argued that while the original might outclass it by a tad scream is both scarier and funnier it certainly doesn't skimp with shocks a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart i actually questioned craven and williamson's judgment here considering how much this person has added to these films sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab the two scenes we're shown are deadon but for film fans there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like the usual suspects aliens and the empire strikes back still scream does so many things right it's petty to quibble its penchant for parody is irresistible discussions of the merits of film sequels and all the attractive solid cast is a definite bonus and the denouement while not as shocking as scream 's is priceless the film's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in scream with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper all this and a scream is in the works knowing the series' tendency for selfreference perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice mentioning scream 'll help them in their argument",

                "if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending when everything that should happen does unfortunately for the devil's advocate this ending nearly collapses in on itself and ruins the entire film nevertheless the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan well it does contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements and seemingly more interesting ones at that the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session kevin lomax keanu reeves is the defense attorney working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl he ends up with a notguilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury he accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he flies to new york with his wife after proving his worth for selecting juries and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer he graciously accepts where he is treated almost as a god he is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and a hefty paycheck his life seems to be on the rise and of course his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline he is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice especially if it is not wanted meanwhile kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen craig t nelson who apparently murdered three people he spends hours upon hours with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself after a while things turn completely upsidedown as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends a fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevin's real father is it all just a big nightmare or is john milton really satan playing tricks with kevin's life the devil's advocate plays out fairly straightforward but for some odd reason the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed if so the devil's advocate messes up completely and ironically i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film and that is exactly what i got i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what i got but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did i mention that i didn't like the ending the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending they pull the rug out from under you films like seen and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way the devil's advocate on the other hand ends unpredictably not from us knowing a lot but knowing nothing at all if that is confusing i recommend watching the film and then reading that again as for the film overall i enjoyed the entire first two hours being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study the film runs like a wellbuilt clock slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that and then you settle in for a nice resolution which does not occur it was at this point that i felt cheated taking us on a terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around as he is the centerpiece of the film everything occurs from his perspective he is our representation on screen sort of but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game i don't want to spoil the ending so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything it earned its r rating for a reason there is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity this film really isn't subtle about anything showing us everything it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc rating as it is quite harsh however the movie does have its merits and nudity and sex are among those i don't condone sex and nudity in films but if its there i might as well enjoy it the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary ann's problems are incredibly intense and i found myself wanting to witness her decline this may sound uncaring but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her she is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into a world where she is not wanted something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity especially for a film of this nature the story actually has something to say about humanity in one of the last scenes john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children he is satan of course he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity then god sets up rules which contradict human nature this semireligious bashing is more humorous than frightening what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it was funny but patially realizing it was true these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on when a film has something to say about our society it deserves to be watched the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights as we see memorable faces and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she does a great job probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves he has proven himself an uneven actor successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic but he tops himself with this performance i have never seen him more believable to date al pacino is of course the scene stealer his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witches of eastwick and max von sydow needful things he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term jeffrey jones mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past connie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several times one familiar face with a twist was coach star craig t nelson who gives a very good performance the devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore at minutes this film moves along fairly quickly for the first two hours i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters the technical quality is also remarkable with great special effects and a good musical score director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for a long time but just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream personally i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early",

                "note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction the cinematic output from its creator quentin tarantino has been surprisingly low oh he's been busy doing the talk show circuit taking small roles in various films overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn making cameo appearances on television shows providing a vignette for the illfated anthology four rooms everything it seems except direct another featurelength film it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr tarantino's new feature film jackie brown one of the most anticipated films of the year and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the s things aren't going well for jackie brown pam grier she's years old stuck at a deadend job a year plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton and police officer mark dargus michael bowen smuggling from mexico for gunrunner ordell robbie samuel l jackson who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry robert forster the loquacious ordell based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny bonghitting surfer girl melanie bridget fonda and agreeable crony louis gara robert de niro hang out operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat and he's soon out to silence jackie brown meanwhile the authorities' target is ordell and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a halfmillion dollars only through a series of clever twists turns and doublecrosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses although jackie brown marks mr tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation based on the elmore leonard novel rum punch there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black in terms of ambiance the film harkens back to the s from the walltowall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage s productions the opening sequence featuring ms grier wordlessly striding through the lax funky music blaring away on the speakers is emblematic of films of that era the timeframe for the film is in fact but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro of course nothing in the film screams s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists backstabbing and deceptions deliciously unfold the strength of jackie brown is the quiet understated relationship developed between jackie and max when they kiss it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year tenderness in a quentin tarantino film sure there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer or even in reservoir dogs where a deep unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters but for the most part mr tarantino's films are typified by manic energy unexpected outbursts of violence and clever often wordy banter these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr tarantino as simply a helmer of slick hip crime dramas with fasttalking lowlifes and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent he's the real deal this new aspect of mr tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character that of the worldweary sensitive and exceedinglyprofessional max cherry whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching mr forster's nuanced understated performance is the best in the film he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie we smile along with him much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitationera icon pam grier in the lead with the wags buzzing that mr tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's thensagging career as it turns out ms grier is solid in the film's title role although nothing here forces her to test her range i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection though she's been working steadily over the years often in directtovideo action flicks but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks and larry cohen's original gangstas where she first teamed up with mr forster of course it's true that her role here was a godsend a meaty a part as this is rarity for any actress let alone one of her age and current status in the industry while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone it marks tremendous growth of mr tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding and whose characterizations have never been better and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of minutes it's filled with such sumptuous riches ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining inconsequential conversations between the characters that there wasn't an unengaging moment with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt it'll be interesting to see what he tries next",

                "note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned east meets west in mulan the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious massmarket commercial sensibilities this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years but falls short of actualizing its potential though not for lack of trying in many respects mulan is among disney's most mature efforts skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized the imagery of a pillaged village neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy bloodless method imaginable yet how often does a hollywood animated film long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner in an instant idealistic mulan's innocence is lost and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending the film based upon an ancient chinese fable centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones replete with glowing yellow eyes and daggeredged teeth although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western european fables and literature for decades disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere story intact to some neutral territory and revels in its east asian roots aside from a predominantly asianamerican cast providing the film's vocal work there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes invoking pseudoasian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors really included karatechopping blocks of stone in two it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land at its core the film is a tale of heroic adventure and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour perseverance nobility and courage as such animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work handinhand with visual purity scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments particularly during our heroine's characterdefining opening halfhour it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation the friendly animal sidekick the colourful array of supporting characters into the mix where it goes slightly awry off to battle mulan finds herself being trailed by a jivetalking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little lucky cricket who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audiencefriendly comic relief they're affable presences and not precisely ineffective reasonable amounts of humour are elicited and eddie murphy who voices mushu is amusingly earnest but amidst all the high melodrama the effect is mildly jarring and from a storytelling perspective questionable in its necessity at training camp mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits easily characterized simply as the short clown the skinny clown and the big clown who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness and in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns she grows a certain fondness for a handsome squarejawed young captain shang everybody needs love even ancient chinese warrior princesses but not necessarily in this film the romantic angle which lets the air out of the sails of the story's neofeminist underpinnings lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation another staple of recent disney animated films a cache of hummable little ditties has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness composed by matthew wilder none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing and one i'll make a man out of you unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable only reflections an early ballad of lament proves to be a song of any consequence serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga one of musical theatre's most wondrously pure voices nonetheless mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork the computergenerated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive while the blatantly childfriendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable briskly paced with a smart energetic heroine and filled with high adventure the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter",

                "with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately what with that whole clinton thing going on you know million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern oh please government waste my taxes just a bit more would you it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement with this and crimson tide he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting exciting even pretty smart but never totally riveting as cinema and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them and was appropriately scary and all but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant enemy of the state is the same way it's engrossing for its entire running time and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism but it's too technical it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be it casts will smith one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person i hate to do this but last year's film the game got it damn perfect it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling but also the best mindfuck of the entire year not that i want every kafkaesque film to be the game this year's the spanish prisoner succeeds with less thrills and chills but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't will smith's character is frankly too perfect at least too movie perfect he had an affair with another woman lisa bonet ha ha but his relationship with his wife regina king is basically fine regardless he has a kid and he's raking in money as a lawyer albeit a very good and reasonably moral one so he generally doesn't have any real problems as a human being and is therefore boring except that he is played by will smith who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering id men in black territory he's a good dramatic actor just see the first half hour of six degrees of separation for proof of this not that he isn't great the whole time and here he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party a nature observer played by uh jason lee the government wants the disk and is prepared to destroy his life to get it as smith's plight is dramatized we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him sitting in vans disguised as other businesses staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet these guys played by jack black jamie kennedy and seth green are the most interesting part of this film because they're well fascinating they're doing their jobs which are evil but the film doesn't view them as such and they almost become our friends we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains they're also scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world it's as if they're obsessed with their jobs not because they're evil but because hey it's a fun job and no one else can do it like them unfortunately this also backfires a bit on the film instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that the game was you see everything and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on sure you're chilled but you're not exacty freaked out by what's going on but what do you expect from tony scott the man who never met a fivesecond piece of film he ever liked he's a notbad director because hell he is always interesting to watch if not occasionally moronic exhibit a days of thunder but the reason he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated his shots are perfectly executed and leave nothing to the imagination and they're always making sure you're paying attention this is incredibly annoying and it reduces enemy of the state to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths but still manage to entertain without any real problems despite never actually becoming great it's never actually boring and it's always intriguing watching the government setup smith is endlessly fascinating and since we care about smith's likeable protagonist we are setup for a good two hours worth of tom clancyesque entertainment add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos and you've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith's plight without a minute's worth of boredom",

plague life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms although this is the future it looks like a western as the film opens kevin costner his character's name is never revealed is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders running into even worse luck he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem will patton the ragtag retrofuturistic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the clan after a brutal boot camp he and you can see this coming a mile away escapes taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either once he reaches oregon land of beautiful women bright youngsters and rock and roll he pretends to be a representative from the restored

lincoln mercury larenz tate his secondincommand and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner although the movie appeals to my sensibilities there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted it's derivitive of costner's own waterworld and clint eastwood westerns there's little here that we haven't seen dozens of times before the film is often downright corny a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a brighteyed child is embarrassing in its slowmotion banality the film's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor despite the film's excessive three hour length several things are never explained what was the war about how did civilization change so rapidly everyone has horses where did all they come from the law of eights that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film but where are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn't made their way west to help or conquer there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn't appear to make sense the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments but beyond that there are some oddities the evil army is called holnists which sounds coincidentally like the new age holism but why is it another coincidence that it takes place in just one year after many ancient prophesies including the ending of the mayan calendar predict a new world for mankind why is the general named bethlehem there seems to be some reason for that but what sometimes the movie feels like a joke an army of postal workers armed with guns considering the headlines of recent years it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys it's even more difficult to accept those repowering the federal government as the heroes given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government it's asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film's nationalism even with its numerous flaws the movie all comes together if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have it's doubtful that the postman is going to find much of an audience but a few of us are going to have a good time besides we're all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year millennium computer bug michael redman has written this column for over years and would like to announce that the michael redman arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is to the best of his knowledge not him perhaps this similarlynamed

                "here's a word analogy amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park in after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit many critics described schindler's list as the director's penance as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowdpleasing blockbuster now after a threeyear layoff spielberg is back with a vengeance once again his summer release was special effectsloaded actionadventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers now following his pattern he has fashioned another serious inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity that film is amistad although not as masterful as schindler's list amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture thematically rich impeccably crafted and intellectually stimulating the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact watching schindler's list was a powerful almost spiritual experience spielberg pulled us into the narrative absorbed us in the drama then finally let us go exhausted and shattered threeplus hours later aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since amistad while a fine example of film making is not as transcendent the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books but considering who writes the texts that's not a surprise however the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric and while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account most of the basic facts are in order several mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force on the whole while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired one stormy night during the summer of the men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape led by the lionhearted cinque djimon hounsou they take control of the vessel killing most of the crew adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey they are tricked however and the la amistad which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison charged with murder and piracy the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson morgan freeman and lewis tappan stellan skarsgard they are soon joined by roger baldwin matthew mcconaughey a property attorney of little repute aided by advice from former president john quincy adams anthony hopkins baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for and his central argument that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men not property convinces the judge but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause current president martin van buren nigel hawthorne eager to please southern voters and year old queen isabella of spain anna paquin begins pulling strings behindthescenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free at its heart amistad is a tale of human courage cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to he is a free man not a slave and while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle he will not give it up effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies they are individuals and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success to amplify this point spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' pointofview detailing their occasionallyhumorous observations about some of the white man's seeminglystrange rituals the larger struggle is of course one of defining humanity as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as subhuman so the proslavery forces of amistad use a similar defense the abolitionists regard the africans as men but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property in a sense the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war which would break out less than three decades later looming over everything amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history four claimants come forward against the africans the state which wants them tried for murder the queen of spain who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an americanspanish treaty two american naval officers who claim the right of high seas salvage and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad who demand that their property be returned to them baldwin must counter all of these claims while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier they gradually learn to communicate aside from cinque who is a fullyrealized individual characterization is spotty but the acting is topnotch matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his pretty boy image to become baldwin but the lawyer is never particularly welldefined outside of his role in the la amistad case likewise while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan they are never anything more than abolitionists nigel hawthorne who played the title character in the madness of king george presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election finally there's anthony hopkins whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done hopkins who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer an emotionallycrippled english butler and richard nixon makes us believe that he is adams his tenminute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a welldefined human villain schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superblyrealized amon goeth who was not only a threedimensional character but a personification of all that the nazis stood for there is no such figure in amistad the villain is slavery but an ideology no matter how evil is rarely the best adversary it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist amistad's trek to the screen which encountered some choppy waters author barbara chaseriboud has cried plagiarism a charge denied by the film makers comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has but one thing is certain with spielberg's rousing substantive film leading the way the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history",

                "playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare i mean really who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare and despite the difficulty of their task they have succeeded shakespeare in love is one of the smartest funniest most touching films of the year it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors but here we have a movie that defines success it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written it could have been a smug selfimportant movie that panders to diehard shakespeare fans but the appeal of this film is almost universal if you've ever read a play by shakespeare or know anything about his life it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love joseph fiennes brother of ralph stars as shakespeare himself he's a delightful irresistible lad concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems debt plague etc he's commissioned to write plays for various people queen elizabeth judi dench wants comedies while local slimeball philip henslowe geoffrey rush needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann tom wilkinson shakespeare however has trouble focusing on his work he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel this all changes however when he meets viola de lesseps a radiant gwyneth paltrow a young heiress set to marry the financiallyoriented lord wessex colin firth shakespeare instantly falls in love with her he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo he discovers her identity and confronts her later she of course falls in love with him although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much and soon the production which later becomes romeo and juliet is set to be performed shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film not because it works as great entertainment but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role he has such searing optimism and energy he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character inability to turn away from women attention deficit disorder we sense a great deal of affection and care he practically overflows with passion in every scene fiennes is matched by paltrow whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in the two performers work perfectly together taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh of course it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with stoppard whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor all of his plays have similarly dry humor the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play in the movie shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director i'm going to have to see the movie again i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed in fact i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing stoppard is a master of detail you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film not as lines of a play but as dialogue suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe and the fact that marlowe is played by the openlyhomosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub there's also a scene featuring a wideeyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing there's no dog in this play no no dog the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe wilkinson is also hard to recognize but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously ben affleck playing one of the actors in the company shows great range both in his accent his is almost as good as paltrow's and in humor he has some of the best oneliners in the movie colin firth always stuck playing the sap does a good job being hateful judi dench however has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words my single minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end the story is moving but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes but my quibbling is not important what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture the sheer skill with which it has been written acted and produced shakespeare in love tries so many things and nails every one of them it's a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him a film in which the actors writers and director are all perfectly in sync it's also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare's work in a positive way without seeming condescending or superior i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it",

                "people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple technothriller in such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked but i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff film directed by philip kaufman the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits but the right stuff film isn't even fiction it was based on the nonfiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program the plot of the film begins in when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach mach speed and thus break the sound barrier many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado but one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records ten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age in order to regain

atypical for its time with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for s and s age when hollywood used to make films larger than life but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation in s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies the right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risktaking artsy projects the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film the plot is almost nonexistent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts the film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles sam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty on the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as cleancut marine and future politician john glenn young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard kaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vicepresident lyndon b johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline everything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world in that setting it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights but the times are changing ww alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots their entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicityseeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language editing is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space another fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period this film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws some of the mercury astronauts aren't fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure on the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long also some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america in some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early s time has passed now we don't see astronauts as heroes in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up but this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky and even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema",

                "seen september at p m at rotterdam square mall cinema theater with chris wessell for free using my sonyloews critic's pass theater rating good seats average sound picture unstable rounders is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence but because it's a film that flatout says you can make a career out of gambling and to take make things worse it proves this through its original fascinating story there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life this film starts off in the tradiational noir style introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing matt damon stars as mike mcdermott a something law student in presentday new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played damon narrates throughout the film but the entire opening scene is voicedover so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting mike's about to go up against teddy kgb malkovich a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer but then again he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense the look in his eyes his slow movements his intricate mannerisms all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectlygroomed features but his narration is what brings it all together he never sounds like he's reading from a script nor that he's trying to embellish anything it just comes natural to him the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood from the smell of the air to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards and all without sounding remotely trite immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers but for near geniuses with nerves of steel the game is a quiet war with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it comes to the game of poker all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit we learn only a little about mike both past and present presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues with over his gambling they go through a few breakupmakeup cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison it's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does technically the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the good kid's bad friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives but both share a passion for outthinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them sometimes they pay off i e his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other times they don't i e the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping on a single hand once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places from socialites' mansions to taking the tourists at atlantic city to outwitting the gangsters that control it all everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge martin landou in a perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time matt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer he could go professional as either but with one he could lose everything or win big but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved can someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave if the film had been just a subtle lesson in pokerplaying then the ending is our test everything is told from mike's perspective but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own this makes the final againstall odds showdown seem like just that it works just like the game it revolves around showing us some of the cards but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequences thereof what separates rounders from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end",
                "you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk the title is generic it's meaningless and i can't believe it's good business when you pick up the phone and dial film how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jeanclaude van damme movie the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot is called geez maximum risk yuck the movie itself deserves your attention for sweet bloody thrills this one beats the summer blockbuster competition handsdown only mission impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture and therefore more gratifying in its execution much to my surprise van damme continues to develop as a pleasant unpretentious action hero his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold in van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director john woo on a fairly lame movie called hard target if you can find a bootleg copy woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released this followup is directed by ringo lam city on fire full contact whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow here's the rundown van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend jeanhugues anglade finds a corpse that's alain's exact double turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother michael who has been killed by some russian heavies and some strangely american looking cops alain does some investigating he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia assuming michael's identity alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend natasha henstridge the fbi and the russian mob in little odessa that's as much as you need to know the story is adequate but not overly involving and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment there's a love story too but i didn't find it terribly convincing partly because exmodel henstridge is too highstrung in her highprofile debut she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species she's great to look at and she can certainly read a line but what she does here can't really be described as acting of course acting isn't really what she was hired for i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's the movie is exceptionally violent bordering on gratuity keep that in mind when planning your date the stunts are spectacular and the fact that you can spot van damme's standin makes his work no less impressive there's only so much you can do with a car wreck but this movie makes crisp effective use of pileups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies and lam has a surprising innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action the main difference between lam and woo i believe is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and doublebarreled points of view to make things run don't get me wrong when chow yunfat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hardboiled it's an amazing moment but it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood for one thing hollywood doesn't yet have chow yunfat while woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city but lam's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style accentuating rather than amplifying the action the performances could have used some fine tuning in particular there's an annoying overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely and the movie doesn't always overcome the limitations of its genre the story is a little mundane although there are some effective moments involving van damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had but it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture and it's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man's best movie and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong konghollywood hybrid",

                "taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers the story centres around a group of people who include brit simon askew and checkout girls claire holmes and ronna polley and the misadventures that they get into split into three chapters everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride liman who also photographed the film has a deft touch with the camera and the film looks good the film also seems to have benefited from a budget with the nightclub scenes in particular looking pretty good there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life holmes one of the dawson's creek cast a show i'm not particularly fond of displays much talent here and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature askew is slightly successful being rather obnoxious no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer who gives an nice evil performance the script written john august is sharp and witty with good dialogue and some funny jokes it starts off rather slow however but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better the stories are largely satisfying although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another also some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky still the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it it could of tried a little harder in some parts however and these parts lag because this is a genxer movie the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany and go's one is pretty decent unlike other genxers movies go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue which is a plus go is a very easy movie to absorb into and the audience really starts feeling for these characters thankfully they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics like the heroine in things i hate about you they are who they are and they stay that way go is great fun and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride erm go to go i guess",

                "it's terribly unfortunate that stir of echoes tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of 's unsung treasures the trigger effect should be released little more than a month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir of echoes is more of a straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to a psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business stir of echoes is more conventional and predictable in its final twist and where the sixth sense was disturbing stir of echoes is just plain scary i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir of echoes opens with a cute sixyearold boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking a bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there finally he asks does it hurt to be dead apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn't the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon a chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hardworking wife one night while at a party with their closest friends tom convinces maggie's newage sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see including a deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months seeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she didn't expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees stir of echoes isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is a terrifically eerie domestic horrordrama and is not only effective on a technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling workingclass family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe 's dream with the fishes are topnotch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through does not try to stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet in a masterfullydone entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching a movie screen from inside a theater which is also showing a movie screen in a theater telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantlyconstrued as this one truthfully this setpiece and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen having loads of fun with her small role as maggie's sister lisa illeana douglas 's to die for her last great character is a delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom's visions of the girl she remarks i wouldn't be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she's dead gives one pause also of note are jenny morrison 's intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in 's whatever as morrison's grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential and it doesn't what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the offkilter frameofmind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realisticallywritten characters stir of echoes isn't as good as the sixth sense but why should it need to be both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is a spinetinglingly good horror film",
                "true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle headon which is probably why so few of them do it even the most religious directors like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get the apostle onto the bigscreen as a matter of fact even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing and he ended up paying for it with million of his own money he also wrote the script directed the film and starred as the central character a fiery texas preacher named euliss sonny dewey few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial technical and creative responsibility singlehandedly and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall and thankfully every bit of that personal investment translates onscreen into power and honest emotion sonny is an energetic pentecostal preacher who has been speaking actually shouting from behind the pulpit since he was twelve he spends much of his time traveling about the country evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers sonny is not a phony or a swindler and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says although like all humans he has weaknesses one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that not only does his longsuffering wife jessie farrah fawcett want to leave him for another man in the congregation but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately his church and his family that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper at his son's baseball game sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat inflicting a wound that may be fatal not knowing what else to do sonny disappears he throws away his identification drives his car into a lake and takes a bus to louisiana hoping to start over again in the tiny mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte sonny once again finds his calling after befriending a simple auto mechanic walt goggins and tracking down the town's exminister john beasley sonny sets up his own church the one way to heaven temple rechristening himself as the apostle e f he quickly draws together an eager congregation and together they realize real change in each other's lives but always sonny's past is lurking a step behind him waiting to swallow his progress duvall has made his intentions in making the apostle clear in a recent article in newsweek he wrote filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit and when they do it tends to be patronizing full of charlatans and snake handlers but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe and to portray it in an accurate way the strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film the apostle always rings true even in the most painful moments because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter after fifteen years of traveling the country listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to i've always called you jesus and you've always called me sonny he says when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs sonny's mother june carter cash just hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to interrupt him the main theme to emerge from the apostle is the fact that good can come from any situation sonny's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing and duvall never shrinks from that fact however that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him in his short time in louisiana he does a world of good and when the police finally show up to take him away he goes quietly knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him and as a scene during the final credits shows he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment it is that strength in sonny's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others he is flawed but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves watching duvall onscreen it's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting as sonny he completely inhabits the character and his performance is certainly the best of the year because he spent so much time absorbing the traits methods quirks and personalities of real preachers duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human as a director duvall feels that less is more his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it with very little intrusion there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive closeups duvall knew that the power of the film's characters enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly nonprofessional churchgoers and actual ministers didn't need to be artificially enhanced in this way the apostle almost plays out like a documentary not only in its technical simplicity but more importantly in its sense of reality",
                "after a rather disappointing mary railly stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise this is one of the best surprises of this season a sweet small budget comedy with a big heart in fact it's not even a comedy it's a drama or even more precise a clever satire on human relationships and needs based on a critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness rob gordon was a dj it seems that he could make everything spin except his own life now he owns championship vinyl a little musical store somewhere in new york when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend a gorgeous blond attorney life suddenly looses every purpose decimated humiliated and on the verge of a mental and emotional breakdown he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been about what's right and what's important he starts categorizing life dividing it into top lists and the most important is the top list over the most painful breakups of his life starting with th grade when he found his young girlfriend with another boy though you might think that people change grow more mature with age it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first where did he go wrong was it he that screwed up or maybe life just stinks while he is lost in his own selfpity he must think of the top list over his needs for the future find the right elements and mix his life together with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity music and with incredibly direct narration it addresses the average audience member in other words people like you and me although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears the director the acting is equally important as the written word and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned he is simply superb it is as much his movie as it is frears' the film would not be the same without him cusack whose character is sadder wiser and brings intelligence and warmth to post mod irony most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera not an easy task but cusack pulls it off his interpretation feels so emotionally right so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job both ______ and jack black are fabulous even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts not just looks beautiful however the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's coworker and friend dick this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscarnomination he is simply a joy to behold otherwise everyone are in their place and at the right time all part of frears' colorful blend pretty much like edward norton's keeping the faith this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre it's dramatic tragic sarcastic comic and even cynical but never bitter or angry it's a little bit of everything pretty much like life itself nothing seems unreal or staged it reflects reality as a mirror as you watch it you go through the same emotional problems as the main character you feel and think and reflect this effect has become a rarity nowadays although it's primarily about the perils of love high fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music rob owns championship vinyl and his employees timid dick todd louiso and overbearing barry jack black are fellow music snobs music is the language in their lives the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives and so does the movie it is as much a musical film as anything else as rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments in the end you have gained something while watching it it's not the film of the century or even of the year it's not an special effects extravaganza it doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed it's a small movie about the big things and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy you feel as if you have experienced something of significance and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time",

                "martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me because of his reputation i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks as much as i enjoyed them i usually felt like i missed something i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies for example in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on or toward the end when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building again the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or goodlooking but he simply uses the best tool for the job it shouldn't have surprised me then that kundun a film about a mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward the movie follows the life of the th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means ocean of wisdom his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story one of which makes an interesting statement pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old his curiosity and selfassuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the dalai lamas who have gone before several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own the boy picks correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama scorsese and longtime editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made a second choice either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise perceptive leader from this point on the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child in the u s it might be grounds for a call to social services but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable wellrounded person certain patterns take shape over the years for example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology radios clocks and telescopes are some of his favorite toys when he is old enough to accept his leadership he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain including herd animals it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor china tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china as first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the armies come across their common border the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays the movie ends when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaves tibet for india the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do it just doesn't fit that mold if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie perhaps more like seven years in tibet which is good in its own right the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events not viceversa perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestments and architecture of tibet a mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold the bricks are a rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie which is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet philip glass composed the music for kundun and he was the perfect choice for those who don't know of glass his music is like a tibetan mandala his building blocks are lots of small notes tiny grains of music which are first grouped then repeated in patterns these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending or talking about its outstanding plot but it does have a lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sights rich cinematography and innovative music it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who gives the film a strong beautiful consistent look",
                "with the success of the surprise hit alien directed by ridley scott a sequel was inevitable in fact after watching the first film a sequel was wanted particularly by this reviewer handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous to this one pirahna ii a surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron a household name the alien series got a facelift of immense proportions instead of being a suspensescience fiction film cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created a film like aliens comes along only once in a while and when it does audiences are usually unprepared for it i never saw this movie in theaters but i wish i could have the terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen with a science fiction plot cameron gives aliens added testosterone pumping up the action and fire power from the original film in fact aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the heroor heroine as the case may be never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual but because of weaver's presence a woman is the only suitable hero aliens begins years after alien ended lieutenant ellen ripley weaver is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens but the company is doubtful they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left despite stern warnings from ripley the company remains rigid and won't call the families back however when the company loses contact with the colony ripley's story seems much more feasible one of the company's directors carter burke paul reiser wants to gather a team to travel to the planet this team includes a buff private vasquez jenette goldstein a questionable corporal hicks michael biehn and a loyal android bishop lance henriksen burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony arriving on the planet the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoontype environment the only survivor is year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become and she becomes newt's surrogate mother ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened and soon all hell breaks loose aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version it also multiplies the number of aliens in general alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens and as a result the chills are incredibly heightened then again this is james cameron the guy who has given us true lies and terminator judgment day he is the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only he could create something as terrifying as this film it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes and aliens has the motherload with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout never dropping for a moment just when you think the movie is over something else will occur and it starts right back up again with a seemingly endless conclusion aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen using flawless special effects the climax is exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety of course for a film of this genre to work properly the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see aliens is completely realistic even a decade after its initial release the special effects are wonderfully seamless with a terrifying alien to go with them one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music composed by cameronregular james horner horner has created a terrific score receiving an oscar nomination for his work not only that horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film or science fiction film ever and that includes a space odyssey which was mainly a compilation of wellknown composers in fact the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music the production design is incredible which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from welllit locations normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer aliens uses lights to scare the viewer then of course is the cinematography which uses point of view shots along with video feeds in order to build suspense some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley surprisingly the acting is not only above average for this genre but some of the best sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hardedged persona weaver soars above the rest in this film but she is supposed to carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child developing a threedimensional character from her quiet attitude lance henriksen is terrific as bishop showing that androids don't always have to be flat characters jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role and steals several scenes of her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn't fighting michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film however biehn does a good job making it seem original again paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages to pull it off quite well however i still see him as paul on tv's mad about you a very good cast which also includes bill paxton and william hope highlights this action film making it stand out from others aliens is rightfully rated r for violence gore language and terror aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre as alien was more of a suspensehorror film aliens pumps up the stakes and cameron directs it with professional quality cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen technically astonishing aliens' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed aside from this you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while",

                "call it touched by a demon gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual horrific twist if marketed properly this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven in fact there's even a little twin peaks to be found here albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out remember bob the biggest failing of fallen is that although it's consistently interesting it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope a serial killer elias koteas has been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force has brought him to justice now during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes what goes around really goes around shortly thereafter he begins to sing time is on my side as he's taken on his last walk minutes later the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead but for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese wasn't a normal psychopath he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel and with reese's death azazel is free to hop from body to body murdering and wreaking havoc at will only hobbes and a pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what they're up against the rest of the cops including hobbes' partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini a newcomer to the department and lieutenant stanton donald sutherland don't have a clue and as a result they are in mortal danger as depicted by hoblit primal fear and cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia is a dark dreary place a gothic city rather than a modern one no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall it's geno's steaks shadows and night scenes abound the days are cloudy and unpromising this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men fallen's plot is brimming with potential not all of which is realized somehow i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise but the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check nevertheless there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual of the several dozen actors to play azazel the best is by far elias koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minutes gives a fantastically charged performance john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick sadly however these two are the only ones who excel everyone else including denzel washington is boring washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film it's not that he's bad per se but he's not very interesting there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keeps us distanced however slightly from hobbes as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop and as his lifeordeath chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this i never felt a sense of urgency however at least washington was believable which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindler's list and donald sutherland to be fair the flaws in their characters aren't all actingrelated neither stanton nor gretta milano are wellwritten that said however there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multidimensional individual narratively fallen has a few glaring weaknesses although the plot proceeds with a convoluted gamelike structure it uses a denzel washingtonsupplied voiceover to overexplain matters at times this is actually helpful and it has a use beyond the obvious but there are occasions when ponderous lines like i like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself become a little hard to swallow in addition fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel however despite the negatives i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending which i loved the final scenes are startling audacious and unexpected it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself this is not a great motion picture but considering how bad most january releases are it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours and whatever you do don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll",

                "it's an interesting premise our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real in truth our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains what we see what we do everything around us is nothing more than a computergenerated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence our bodies severely atrophied are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet the scifi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along the matrix isn't it the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network a sham world the ability to plug one's brain into a computer has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator dark city and a few star trek episodes both classic and next generation what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thoughtprovoking keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo who is plucked out of the artificial world known as the matrix by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computergenerated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines the group's leader morpheus laurence fishburne has chosen neo because he believes neo is the one who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence from the beginning of the film we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out this in a lesser movie would be annoying but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun what is reality what is a sham the film turns our very perception of life on its side more than once we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality or live a life of relative bliss oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings as viewers this is intriguing enough so imagine what it would be like for neo and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves reeves whom i've never really cared for as an actor is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness and little subtlety he was good in speed for example but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely so much of my expectation was happily for naught in a couple of places the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature and this is a heavy credit to writersdirectors andy and larry wachowski i mean since bill and ted's excellent adventure what movie could you say really utilized keanu reeves more interesting than reeves is fishburne who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions and convincingly so very surprising for a scifi movie fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout as if he always knows what to expect this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge hugo weaving as agent smith one of the artificial intelligence's antiintruder programs is also good playing his deadpan nononsense kick ass role which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time unfortunately when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive carrieanne moss plays trinity morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo although her character is somewhat inconsistent moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects many methods of imagery are employed from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics of special note is the use of the freeze and turn effect where the entire scene is frozen turned then continued from a new angle this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semicircle with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends the motion cameras film the action and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second pretty slick the matrix drips with style from the clothing to the music to the action we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film there's a lot of kung fu there's a lot of gunplay when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon called anime by aficionados especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects combined it's really like no liveaction film i have ever seen the film is not without its faults some of the scenes and ideas are borrowed a little too liberally from other films and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing some of the lines are also pretty bad in one instance a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying and it wasn't meant to be a joke however these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action scifi film that for once does more than merely entertain",

                "many people dislike french films for their lack of closure while possibly shallow i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany or at least a resolution in the films which i view there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional however the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passiondenying protagonist stephane daniel auteuil stephane daniel auteuil is a master violin maker he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing even the relationship between he and his boss maxime andre dussollier is a controlled and almost manipulated association highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches in the beginning of the movie stephane is a closed solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man camille kessler emmanuelle beart is a master violinist and the new love of maximes maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife like stephane camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges when stephane and camille meet there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals however whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him stephane ignores his feelings for camille which the audience cannot help but to see is present as the movie progresses the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another these two people with very similar approaches to life initially react to their new circumstance very differently stephane becomes even more rational and controlled while camille becomes more tempestuous until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship however their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well due to his relationship with a master violin teacher however apparently he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing consequently stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays in contrast camille had almost given the violin years earlier however with the aid of her manager she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest successfully submerging herself to her playing during the course of the movie we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions stephane attempts to remain unchanged however we do see subtle hints of his transformation one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash the development of all of the characters many of which is not included in this synopsis is incredible american movies with rare exceptions have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development in its essence this movie is about the development and growth of the characters camille and stephane the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie including a death is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters i am not sure why berardinelli says at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are i find the ending appropriate unfortunately i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling this portion of the film is where the sense of closure could have been successfully accomplished unfortunately there is a hurried and almost a soap operatype surge of emotions from all of the characters while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart ravel has his day in this film the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen the directing in this movie is wonderful the actors and actresses are excellent each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful and needless to say i must say that emmanuelle beart herself is beautiful besides the near ending the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot has their attitude towards love changed i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at but i am unsure of which the director is espousing in summary this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship in the process we see their attitude towards life and other people in itself i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we as americans have preconceived american notions of relationship love and people i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture however i bringing my american preconceptions enjoyed the film i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it",
                "note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned like its own opening shot from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking the film follows a softspoken young man eddie adams mark wahlberg from torrance through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom and later to a harrowingly precipitous drop as boogie nights opens he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity recruited by fatherly jack horner a rejuvenated burt reynolds a successful porn filmmaker eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler pornstar wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe including the maternal amber waves julianne moore reed rothchild john c reilly buck swope don cheadle rollergirl heather graham dirk and his one special thing are quickly propelled to the top of his field fulfilling his mantra of being a big bright shining star his lack of discipline however incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr anderson whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool mr anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating impertinent and selfcongratulatory case in point marc rocco's unforgettable perpetualmotion helming of murder in the first in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr anderson be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp is purposeful and potent it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career boogie nights is only his second feature film following up his debut feature from earlier this year hard eight and although it's somewhat derivative his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese at least he's borrowing from some of the best and it's entirely effective within the context of this film while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music clothes hairstyles dance idioms and culture aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent preaidsscare period in american history where uninhibited freewheeling lifestyles abounded while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of nowoutdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society a prime example is parttime salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eighttrack tape and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule but of wistful reminiscence and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny to be sure but oddly magical and the sequence which lovingly explores eddiedirk's bedroom completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic s figures farrah fawcett cheryl tiegs bruce lee is breathtaking ably supported by a wellselected collection of period music all of which purportedly came straight from mr anderson's personal collection there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters after the debacle with 's milos forman film the people vs larry flynt another finelycrafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornographyrelated storyline the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public however while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago it's hardly a lurid or seamy film given the subject matter there's very little nudity and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality but simply as a business the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate there's a candid matteroffactness in terms of sex his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking such as coercion or debauchery are avoided if anything boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves jack horner's dream is an honourable one he genuinely aspires to make a great film and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence in both films the world of quickie lowbudget filmmaking is explored and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton scott alexander and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets jack's retort of there are shadows in light baby to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's it's not about the little details it's about the big picture rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan from outer space appears patently false in boogie nights and ed wood the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing not in their intentions there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture but in the degree that they miss the mark much like the humour lacing ed wood the laughs involving jack horner are doubleedged after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres when jack breathes this is the best work i've ever done it's genuinely funny but given his utter sincerity also possesses a tinge of sadness mr anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges when one considers that the film's protagonist literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire minute running time it's no wonder why the playfully inane how much can you bench banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges and while mr anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff better suited for a less risque and uninspired tvmovie version of her character's story and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions still even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters mr anderson most definitely captures their essences and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious misguided even aimless hopelessly naive selfdestructive insufferable i loved them just the same in any case it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired and ultimately bestexecuted scenes of the year a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loosecannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance even if it's a small one in a suicidal drug deal scam only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's sister christian on his stereo system is sheer brilliance flanked by an armed bodyguard if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements mr anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room pushing the scene to a new surreal level of delightful giddiness there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights mr anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight here it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect similarly a painful scene where crew member scotty j philip seymour hoffman breaks down in tears in the driver's seat sobbing i'm so stupid after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening boogie nights is exceedingly well cast and each of the actors rise to the occasion the ensemble cast is uniformly good while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr wahlberg fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films and mr reynolds terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film ringing true in every respect a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention mr reilly demonstrates here as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia a genuine aptitude for comedy many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee mr reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad and deadon period it sure sounds like bad early s to me demo track you got the touch in a vain attempt at a musical career mr reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective ms graham with her long dirty blonde hair innocent demeanour and huge hazel eyes looks like a disney animated heroine come to life or in this case a disney animated heroine who came to life made a wrong turn and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late s early s adult film industry consequently it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweetfaced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets garish red lipstick messily smeared on giving the camera a hilariously pouty comehither look all one can do is gulp her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out err in a figurative sense she's essentially a glorified extra but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity if only mr anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face though and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish as a teen ms graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers since then her most notable roles have been as a junkie gus van sant's drugstore cowboy and now a porn starlet draw your own conclusions perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr cheadle who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st vincent an interesting melora walters is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry while the scenario is familiar the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way and here he plays a variation on the same character maurice t rodriguez is a hapless but goodnatured nightclub owner who's a hangeron to jack's group ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack with little disguise made of his desperation for a part in one of his erotic pictures jack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr anderson who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work striking a fine balance between humour and drama and exceptionally wellcrafted there's no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year",

real human beings we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor but he had that unique quality in his eyes in gridlock'd an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire shakur and his costar tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry shakur and roth play ezekiel

comatose after a drug overdose spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab but that proves to be easier said than done as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy confusion and red tape the government might be the least of their obstacles however as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer and on the run from a nasty thug vondie curtis hall in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie they are going to government offices on new year's day in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey 's falling down which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles in falling down michael douglas' dfens the character's

off the hook for their own part in the situation one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question do you expect the world to stop just because you picked _today_ to clean up the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system but perhaps not enough of them a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from dreper and from the police and those subplots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments in one scene stretch scares off dreper by getting chummy with a police officer another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenlysuspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through selfdestructive behavior oh the irony of it tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case and living the life to back it up in gridlock'd shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction mostly it comes through those eyes eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite and roth plays stretch with a gleeful selfdestructiveness he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch helping spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife

                "catherine deane jennifer lopez is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane's mental faculties a vicious serial killer named carl stargher vincent d'onofrio has been kidnapping women locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into lifesized dolls just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia the police led by fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state in a last ditch attempt they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell a cell which will completely fill with water in the next hours initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix while it does share some characteristics with both films particularly the first forty minutes which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm the buzz around this project is that firsttime feature film director tarsem singh who won many awards for his video of r e m 's losing my religion wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story and a good portion of this film supports that theory despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments the cell does feature some remarkable imagery all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful including the dank mind of stargher whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h r giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film involving a horse which no one seeing this film will probably forget a zoolike display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant but alas the sequences only become more silly as they go along despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images but at least vincent d'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance magnified by ten thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed in my opinion d'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful i e the newton boys feeling minnesota the thirteenth floor and the velocity of gary that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film as it contains heavy doses of both besides the nipple ring removal i mention above there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs prior to his catatonia and capture which will have audiences recoiling a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spitlike device as a narrative film the cell is sorely lacking as a collection of images though the cell is extremely well done although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half singh has done what he supposedly set out to do make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together unfortunately a wellwritten script should have been considered too because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv provided of course that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos",

                "it's wednesday march and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte south carolina the crime a young prostitute elizabeth renee zellweger has been brutally slain one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority miles away the police duo of braxton chris penn and kennesaw michael rooker are strapped for leads at the moment they have only one possible suspect wayland tim roth a wealthy unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act that's the premise for deceiver a new thriller from the pate brothers jonas and josh who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not sobright cops captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is by contrast kennesaw's is and braxton's is the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered over three days as wayland returns to answer more questions the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until inevitably it boils over other plot elements are thrown in for good measure wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can in stressful situations render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent braxton a compulsive gambler is deep in debt to a local syndicate and kennesaw is haunted by a dark abusive side that delights in terrorizing women especially his wife rosanna arquette whom he suspects of being unfaithful the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand the suspect or his questioners deceiver which mostly transpires in a dimlylit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue has the feel of a david mamet play edgy claustrophobic and tense the atmosphere is explosive and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting deceiver has the power to grab an audience unfortunately in the end it succumbs to the need to throw in one last unexpected twist and this is its undoing for while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers it also stretches our credulity too much and raises more questions than it answers it's only an effective wrapup if you don't think too carefully about its full implications of course the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction not plot details deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voiceover by visually showing what really happened moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks the movie obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir drips atmosphere there are some fascinating stylistic touches for example although the setting is contemporary all of the telephones are oldfashioned rotary models cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look some of the things he tries mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow work exceptionally well while others like any of several lazy susan shots seem more like unnecessary visual tricks as wayland tim roth gives the film's top performance despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be the other two leads chris penn and michael rooker aren't as effective both play their characters like familiar types penn's performance is uninspired rooker's lacks subtlety some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors renee zellweger in a role that's miles away from her starmaking turn in jerry maguire brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience plot points aren't hammered home and although the ending has its weaknesses everything isn't spelled out in bold letters the pates give audience members credit for having brains which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers occasionally gripping and never uninteresting deceiver is a fine noir effort",

                "with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the film noir genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control fargo miller's crossing blood simple and offthewall comedies centered around an eccentric scatterbrained lead character raising arizona the hudsucker proxy their latest offering the big lebowski falls within the latter category though there are elements of the crimegonewrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film the main difference however is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling smoke pot and generally relax that main character is jeffrey the dude lebowski jeff bridges introduced by the film's rambling narrator sam elliott as quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county the dude is

of a head case than walter if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone then perhaps this will the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the big lebowski david huddleston and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny tara reid owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ben gazzara the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug he doesn't have any luck but when bunny is apparently kidnapped the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the million ransom unfortunately walter gets involved and fouls up the dropoff and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers the dude's car gets stolen along with the briefcase containing the money soon the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german nihilists who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn meanwhile the big lebowski's daughter maude julianne moore a feminist avantgarde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked wants to recover the money for her family the plot however is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's run through the jungle and it fits the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully the film doesn't feature quite as many oneliners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution there's also a noticeable but not too heavyhanded thread of social commentary in the big lebowski which incidentally takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin at the beginning we see george bush on television making his this aggression will not stand speech the coens take aim at just about every elite l a subculture in the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bums will always lose shouts the big lebowski at one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and so on by the end we really start to admire the dude who almost certainly harbors the least aggression of anyone in this story his passive resistance emphasis on passive albeit to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters he also turns out to have a pretty wellfunctioning brain in his head even if he doesn't like to use it very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either i think that more than anything is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy it manages to approach characters like the dude and to some extent walter with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatterbrained audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the undynamic duo by the end of the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first it's good knowin' he's out there the dude takin' it easy posits the narrator towards the end i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken",
                "dark city is such a rare treat it s a stunning hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london to boot it is accompanied by an intense well written and thoughtful story movies of this caliber and idea aren t made too often and it s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it alex proyas who s previous film the crow looked good but couldn t cover up the terrible acting or story here shows a near masterpiece a combination of metropolis edward hopper and phillip marlowe fused seemlessly at times it moves beyond film into artwork it is the story of strangers aliens from another planet and we know they re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats one of the detractions of the film who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live what makes up our soul these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ultimate technology of shaping matter with their mind called tuning they are aided by a human scientist played by kiefer sutherland who has betrayed his kind and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight during this time john murdoch played swiftly by rufus sewell wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light a terrific visual effect not only is murdoch confused but so is the audience without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer he receives a phone call to flee as the strangers are after him i don t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop in a way regaining murdoch s identity along with him it s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography murdoch s wife anna is introduced through a stunning beam of light she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight shadows outlines of men in hats watch as she gently curves through the shine we see the outline of her body from behind an hourglass as she sings a slow rhythmic song a great entrance however a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied the city is nice to look at but if it s a poor story then it s not worth watching blade runner was popular not only because it s visuals but it s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience it is discussed it and argued therefore a success other science fiction films of recent times such as the fifth element are nice to look at but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy we re left with love conquers all after finishing the fifth element dark city is not so easily explained away as the strangers discovered locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task where is reality dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the s and ranks along with the best made in the s such as blade runner and the two aliens films perhaps it s the best of the both decades it had the darkness of the aliens films as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner but moved beyond i think because the themes behind it were much stronger anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write i d love to hear it",
                "i was pleasantly surprised by this film with a budget topping million i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see how much could you dress up the sets how many models and computer effects could you use how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks oh if i've just given away part of the plot for you go back to school after having viewed titanic however i found it to be a wellpaced welldesigned and overall wellmade movie there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen titanic tells its story in two time periods it starts out in the present when ocean explorer brock lovett bill paxton and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace which is broadcast on the news the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas there she tells her story to lovett and his team in rose dewitt bukater kate winslett a young lady belonging to society's upper class boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing from southampton england to new york she is engaged to cal hockley billy zane an heir to old money and a snob in every sense of the word on board rose feels the stifling trappings of highsociety's expectations and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern but is saved from her selfproclaimed fate by jack dawson leonardo dicaprio a passenger in thirdclass steerage as it's referred to who talks her out of jumping although for rose the attraction is not immediate a love affair soon develops between the two which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal the story sounds very simple and perhaps even unexciting but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron a good movie comes through dicaprio is marvelous as the young but worldlywise jack playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors his is a character that is immediately likable as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations girls are going to swoon over him winslet also proves herself a good actress delivering her lines convincingly and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing simply by judgment of her gait i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an uppercrust debutante rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess she sometimes looks positively clumsy and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him his features are such that even when he smiles there's something mistrustful about him and when he scowls he is evil incarnate he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher but a cheaper model like dicaprio and winslet zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy cal's personal assistant or man as they said at the turn of the century no matter who else is in the cast you can always count on a good performance by warner who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match additionally there are a number of smaller fictional and nonfictional roles thrown in for color such as kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi eric braeden as john jacob astor and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie nice to see dr bombay getting work also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the firstclass passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else in this way titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop but a very real account of class struggle as well as i mentioned before the budget for this film was tremendous and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic with regard to the exteriors i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank but only had room for and therefore had to computergenerate the remaining feet could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater as the splicing is seamless also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship how the flooding occurred the way the ship sank and why it did so in that manner these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion in all james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story history and action the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements from the movie's intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending in box office receipts titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship",
                "as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on dday the weary seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck as the flap falls the battle begins they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire amid the chaos of this massacre stands a shot that at least for me hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler's list a soldier clearly missing an arm wanders around the bodystrewn beach like a lost puppy we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself he bends over picks up his arm and starts to carry it probably not bothering to ask himself what now saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film the direction is out of this world surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar the cinematography by janusz kaminsky is also astounding but be forewarned this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get the question is does the story and its realism justify the excessive use the answer from my point of view is no braveheart was a truly gritty and one would imagine realistic battle film ryan is ten times worse expect disembowelments sucked in skulls heads blown to bits arms and legs flying across the battlefield many in the theater could not bear to watch and it is a shame too because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters and academy members saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on dday through into the film's primary mission captain miller hanks assembles an man crew and sets off to find a missing solider private ryan whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs ryan doesn't recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons that no person should suffer such injustice miller's crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan though they don't yet know him they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn't have any more or less right to live than any of them this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and though there is a lot of set up between battles the story continues full speed to the end the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it's own spielberg though not a student of the quick cut school of filmmaking takes a stab at it here and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it bay should pay close attention take copious notes if you want to jump cut every two seconds do it the way spielberg does it in ryan in the end the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the importance of the film schindler's list taught many people the truth about the holocaust it opened eyes sparked debate and study though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before they don't amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler's list overall this is just the truest depiction of the old adage war is hell but braveheartdosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again masterful work marred only by excessive gore",
                "the bond series is an island in the film world where else would we look forward to cliches and all of the other things that occur in most of these films where else would pure escapism a vulnerable hero the talking villains blatant product placement predictable action sequences and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change i don't understand it myself but that's what the bond series is based on for i think films we've mostly got the same thing over and over again with some variation and a bit of change most notably in the two dalton films but even i a king of cynicism can't bitch about it and tomorrow never dies the again i think eighteenth bond film and second brosnan bond film is no exception thank god the plot as in most of them is pure balderdash but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it instead of just plain billionaire psychotics we get a rupert murdochesque media mogulpsychotic elliot carver jonathan pryce looking bitching with a whitehaired cru cut and always talking like he's out of breath who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war no this is not wag the dog he wants a real war between china and england and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it in comes bond james is sent all around the world trying to do research on carver fighting with his men and running into on more than one occasion a chinese secret agent like him wai lin michelle yeoh asian action star extraordinaire and costar of supercop nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one the two eventually and predictably of course begin working together and yes there is some sexual tension between the two luckily their relationship is never strained and she never gives into his cassanovaness until the finale thank god again in every bond film james bags on average three women sometimes more sometimes less the latter being more potent towards the aidscautionary dalton and he doesn't spoil this one though we never see them of course i mean they need to stay around a pg rating there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again the big bond girl yeoh and this time we have an almostcameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife paris who it seems was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning yes teri's very attractive but she seems kind of dull of course it's not really her fault her part is underwritten and she's only in a small part of it oh well and there are always the big henchmen the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains this time we get a tall arianlooking not to mention robert shaw in from russia with love looking guy named stamper goetz otto who is pretty awesome although a bit stiff well mostly his posture really and for a bit of comedy we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point the government people have small parts as usual with q desmond llewelyn looking near death sadly getting only one scene in a more grouchy mood than usual and m judi dench getting more than m usually gets i mean it is judi dench and for no reason whatsoever except 'cause he was so good in goldeneye joe don baker shows up again as wade admitting he has no reason for being there and is this time more annoying again oh well the action sequences are not a letdown although sometimes go on too long they pop up every now and then mainly because they have to for the sake of the series and some significant ones are the opening one one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control and a motorcylce chase on a bmw cycle nonetheless through china streets or was it vietnam the plot's not really essential they're more hightech and feature much more laughs which yeah i dig so what if they're distracting they're supposed to be the acting from most around is great yeoh is actually one of the better bond girls mainly because she's so unique the better bond girls are more independent and have a certain wilyness to them pussy galore with her homoerotic undertones and all is one of the best and diana rigg who married bond at the end of on her majesty's secret service only to be killed added some emotional depth yeoh is notable since she's so active and has great chemistry with brosnan pryce is an awesome villain being slimy and lovable at the same time and brosnan is once again the mack daddy the bond series is built on cliches mainly because they're so fun and add to the escapism if you can remember the dalton years and they're serious direction you remember how unsuccessful they were both financially and aesthetically the series would falter if bogged down with too much plot too many themes and too much characterization i don't really understand it myself yet i'm one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states having seen all of them more than once yes i've seen this twice already you can tell i adore them while it's not one of the best like goldfinger or from russia with love tomorrow never dies is nonetheless a truly awesome installment even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones",

already been said since the release of 'rumble in the bronx back in the u s release jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america's video shelves having made over films jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of actioncomedy to the west his latest release shanghai noon is a joyful tribute spoof of the classic western and by adding jackie chan into the genre the tag line for the film the western gets a kick in the pants rings true jackie stars as chon wang a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china the royal princess pei pei lucy liu is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture unwilling to follow her father's wishes princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor decides to escape to america but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong which will lead to the princess' kidnapping and ransom unable to take any legal action the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city's bravest guards played by cui ya hi rong guang yu and eric chen are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city nevada chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team as he is looked upon as a buffoon on a train in the u s jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon owen wilson he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him with his gang in tow roy attempts to rob the train when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court who also happens to be chon wang's uncle chon wang gives chase foiling the attempted robbery but also leaving himself stranded in the desert as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert he again comes upon roy who has been left for dead by his former gang buried up to his neck in the desert roy pleads with chon to dig him out chon demands to know where carson city is roy directs him and chon leaves but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors a friendly sioux tribe gunslingers a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride brandon merrill before once again running into roy shanghai noon is just good fun the chemistry between the cast is remarkable the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before he's not called on to do much acting here as the character is not written with any depth but jackie's natural charisma shines through and his comic timing is so perfect both physically and surprise verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on owen wilson last seen in the embarrassing remake of the haunting gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon his innocence is refreshing and fun a bad guy that's not really bad his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant the character is a noble woman of status and wealth but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances nothing here is realistic mind you shanghai noon is first and foremost a light jovial film and the performances match that style with ease the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous using calgary alberta as the prime location mr mindel is able to create a lush romantic western feel to the film nothing here really looks like nevada but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre and as such the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history but with reverence to past films homage to such films as high noon obviously red river and most notably butch cassidy the sundance kid all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film it is a comforting experience at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and dare i say clich s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre this is the purest horse opera since the days of george o'brian or john wayne director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood's past in this his first film mr dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see nothing here really stands out or takes one's attention away from the story or action and that is as it should be when jackie chan is your star and what of the action and stunts well while not up to a level of drunken master or any of jackie's hong kong films shanghai noon is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before his timing choreography and creativity are still as sharp as ever jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films obvious to those of us that have seen those films but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar finally jackie can honestly say that he has made an u s his way and incorporating his style to sum up shanghai noon is a fun summer confection not too heavy and not too light a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy parents be advised there are scenes of smoking drunkenness and peyote use an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again",

                "zero effect gets its title from the main character daryl zero bill pullman although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film zero is a private investigator perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived at least he'd like to think so however he's a socially inept being and eccentric in every possible way this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are zero's accomplice is steve arlo ben stiller a normal guy who does the business side of the job he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soontobe client gregory stark ryan o'neal it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about zero takes the case and the plot thickens his path leads to a young pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan kim dickens despite her luminous and seeminglyharmless presence she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark through his investigations zero learns why but not without developing feelings for gloria feelings that because of his reclusive behavior are new and confusing to him i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators and every once in a while a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away actually no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness zero effect which is jake kasdan's first effort as writerdirector is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts it's an original funny and completely involving motion picture with so many cliches available to this genre i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws he has created a great film here one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment take for starters the great cast of characters pullman is terrific as zero showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance and the occasional voiceover as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious ben stiller is also a very funny individual he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny i'll shoot you he says to stark at one point i have a gun and everything his character is also welldrawn with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend angela featherstone who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth and kim dickens last seen and underused in mercury rising gets a chance to show us her talent here giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film kasdan's humor is of the best kind soft spoken and mostly dialoguedriven though there are some great visual jokes it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is an how that makes him such a great detective what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed or standing motionlessly with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face his eyes pointing to something off camera but obviously to nothing in particular i can't convey to you how funny this is but what makes it great film making is that it has a point scenes like this are frequent and they provide solid characterization of zero as a side note i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy not to sound elitist i find things funny that many do not and vice versa there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest jake kasdan son of writerdirector lawrence kasdan is only years old i found this out after seeing the film and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker his direction is stylish without being pretentious and his writing is mature full and developed zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection smart original films like this are rare as it is but this one actually has a heart and a soul at the end of the film i was involved in the characters and i was satisfied

                "confession time i have never ever seen gone with the wind i don't know why really haven't wanted to check it out on video haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the bigscreen so right up front i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about but here goes is titanic the gone with the wind of the 's maybe that's going a little bit too far as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie they're no clark gable and vivien leigh but the parallels are there gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available technicolor titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy they both have strongwilled redheaded heroines they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slavessteerage bums they were both incredibly expensive and popular ok maybe that's not enough parallels so titanic's not in gwtw's league no matter titanic is a great movie in its own right complete with spills thrills and especially chills much has been made of the humongous cost of the production and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again the money was obviously wellspent the costumes look great the sets look great the cgi graphics look great i especially liked the expensive little touches like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks but writerdirectorproducer james cameron's real challenge in writingdirecting producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in he succeeds masterfully cameron does two things that work incredibly well first he shows us modernday salvage operations on titanic that's just titanic not the titanic mind you the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues yearold rose calvert gloria stuart who survived the wreck in stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew secondly cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character and the romantic triangle between rose winslet her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley billy zane and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio the way that bigbudget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an allstar cast so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board the supporting cast is professional but mostly anonymous other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown there's no moment when you stop and say oh yeah i know him what's he been in although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform or even as the illfated engineer the love story itself is rather conventional i think some reviewers found it weak and that may be a fair criticism the performances are the key here zane has the meatiest part in the movie and he plays the arrogant condescending steel millionaire to the hilt he's smooth he looks great in a tuxedo and he's a convincing enough jerk that the winsletdicaprio relationship looks plausible at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat you can hear the wheels in his mind turning saying not can i save this little girl but can she help me get on a lifeboat dicaprio is a revelation i hadn't seen him before in anything and didn't know what the heck to expect really honestly i expected a bad irish accent but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive and being on the titanic that it's hard not to like him from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest and he never falters winslet's character grows up a lot during the movie and so does her performance at first she's not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look dropdead gorgeous we know from the narration that she's monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane but there isn't any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg it's at that moment where winslet's character really comes alive faced with real danger she drops her spoiledrichgirl mannerisms and does a splendid job as rose and jack race around the doomed ship looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal's fiery temper winslet turns in a superb acting performance mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror of course the most interesting character is the ship itself cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic and shows her in every mood as a deserted wreck down in the boiler room up on the bridge down in the hold at the captain's table down in steerage and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead cameron's greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well",

                "star wars episode the phantom menace review by matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas' classic star wars the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more americans today can explain what the force or a jedi is than a budget deficit or a serb so years after the release of the original and years since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons against this challenge the fourth star wars film episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week and despite some early critical reviews in the major media the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is a worthy sequel er prequel to the original star wars films the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films as the film opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars is only a young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor quigon jinn liam neeson the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations but in the middle of a planetary invasion rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battledamaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice on tatooine quigon discovers a young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts quigon senses the child is unusually strong with the force and begins to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being a galactic savior the innocentlooking yearold will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out a lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sounds a bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knights anakin's turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story moves quickly with the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused it's unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movies were clearly luke's story with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obiwan's if this trilogy is centered on anakin it's a shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers and as a result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his littleboy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that quigon is willing to believe he is the one the rest of the cast does fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight mcgregor is wellcast as obiwan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fits the role of a young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters but the interaction between them individually the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another in star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obiwan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other individually they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaursized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers on venetianlooking planet of naboo watch a spectacular event part romanchariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings he creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines most of the new special effects in his rereleased special edition trilogy in were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made more than ever in this new film lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures robots with personalities and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters the best such character is watto a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room of all the computergenerated characters in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computergenerated characters no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks with more than minutes of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computergenerated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs a comicrelief role in the film lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors however despite the technological magic that makes his character possible jar jar isn't completely convincing he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends a roger rabbit like presence you accept that he's there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially i found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film on my second viewing of the film jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the film's struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about one's destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar to a oneman twoheaded announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling podrace sequence to a cameo appearance by e t in the film the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun with lots of halfhidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace works because as in all his films there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning to end there are lightsaber battles hairraising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil the podrace sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film and the final showdown between obiwan quigon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed the phantom menace won't win any major oscars it probably won't beat titanic's box office record and it's not even the best star wars film i'd put it third after the original and the empire strikes back but it's an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film can't live up to it's hype no film not even the original star wars could have done that but it's still worth seeing probably more than once",
                "the happy bastard's quick movie review analyze this how does one do a comedy focused on the mob well a few years ago there was a sly little comedy called the freshman which had marlon brando doing a romp of a sendup of his famous don corleone character and recently the utterly stupid in a bad way movie mafia failed to really get the joke this time around however warner bros may have gotten it right with analyze this a movie that hits its targets more than it misses and for plenty of reasons the story goes like this a mobster robert deniro finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a neardeath following a driveby shooting it's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist billy crystal who's mostly reluctant to take the mobster's case for two reasons first of course he's a mobster but secondly he's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife lisa kudrow and kid and of course he can't rest worth for a moment because the mobster's goons are always needing the shrink for something be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation fortunately the movie is played out for plenty of laughs director harold ramis who also helmed the comedy multiplicity which wasn't half bad keeps the tone peppy and light even if it's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments shootings can't always be taken for laughs you know deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas but with a bit of a lighter heart a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro's character uplifting him from such bombs as father's day and my giant kudrow is also a hoot as crystal's wifetobe who's on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro's presence is the movie perfect not really thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri he's a comic actor too come on give him some more but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show either line of the movie crystal when you said you needed family therapy this is not the family i had in mind",
                "the heartbreak kid reviewed on aug th starring charles grodin cybill sheppard eddie albert in the heartbreak kid charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i've seen on screen in a long time he's a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film as the film opens he has just gotten married and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon halfway there he begins to resent his bride by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character he is ready to divorce his wife as played by grodin this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him the phrase the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence was practically written with him in mind however if he finds something he really wants he will pursue it for as long as it takes the only problem is once he has it he immediately loses interest the end of the heartbreak kid is both hilarious and sad for that very reason charles grodin is at his smarmy best here and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin's desire however the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin daughter of director elaine may as grodin's whiny bride she owns every scene that she's in and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do the heartbreak kid was written by neil simon and it shows simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships and he's at the top of his game here as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is he's the type of guy that everyone knows the character of george costanza on seinfeld seems to have been modelled after him the only problem with the film is that it's not that funny and it's billed as a comedy as much as i could see the realism in the characters it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there the heartbreak kid is not a date movie it has an extremely negative view of relationships so seeing it with a girlfriendboyfriend could be hazardus to your health",
                "labelling is sometimes everything in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones on the other hand producers were right on the mark walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america to make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based on anabasis historical book written by xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia years ago instead of ancient persia movie begins in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warriors local youth gang gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city the gathering organised by gramercy park riffs most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx that is far away from warriors' home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce on the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riffs announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city crowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogues led by psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus police simultaneously raids the gathering and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing and their leader gets killed by riffs the remaining eight led by cleon's lieutenant swann michael beck must now try to get to coney island but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs upon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status however despite being one of the best movies of that year and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america he failed miserably the future was much worse than his vision the youth gangs as presented in the warriors are far from shadowy armies able to take over entire cities their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime in their vocabulary word arms is reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns they even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour despite those objections the warriors have all the elements of a very good film the plot is simple and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie editing is superb events happen at quick pace with the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his wouldbegirlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable yet the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity best known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains michael beck as cool almost statesmanlike leader of a gang is also very good and james remar gives good contrast as his hotshot contender for top spot all in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies",

aircraft after a handful of others including one teacher follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane the unwitting survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize but death won't be cheated so easily and one by one the survivors of flight are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi before i delve into the meat of the review i'd just like to confer is that one helluva premise or what final destination' creepy beyond rational comprehension probably reads more like an unsettling xfiles' episode than the simpsons' therefore the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong on familiar turf the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong and the opening minutes of final destination' reflects that unlike most thrillers the setup is crisp and cool you just deeply sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool leaving us with a secondstring effort with nothing but cheap derivative shocks young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration what with i know what you did last summer' and sequel idle hands' and a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil urban legend' after the setup when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair i started to really have fun with final destination' low and behold a teen thriller that is actually unsettling actually suspenseful and yes actually intelligent some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside this film is among the most refreshing and allout enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cuttingedge scream' in final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the bloodspattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years not that the characters are that good sawa is game as alex a connectthedots personality that we never fully comprehend in addition the survivors are endearing geek tod chad e donella jocky controlfreak carter kerr smith of dawson's creek' carter's ditzy girlfriend terry amanda detmer the nonetoosubtly named billy hitchcock seann william scott supplier of lukewarm comic relief and a lone teacher the emotionally delicate ms lewton kristin cloke aside from alex the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter varsity blues' playing an abstract character named clear rivers what were her parents thinking the personality of clear is written with such a vague nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flashcard saying hello i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ' toss a few stereotypical fbi agents daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith and a ummm spiritual' mortician former candyman' tony todd into the mix and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing dicing and assorted disembowelments not so final destination' has no slicing and dicing or at least none dealt by a human killer and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying murdererontheloose' concept with assistance from a shrewd intelligently paced screenplay by morgan wong and jeffrey reddick the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity listen up reindeer games' but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of final destination' is the murder scenes creative resourceful and breathlessly inventive the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise what will trigger the accident will it be the john denver record just put on to play rocky mountain high' yeah sick humor will it be the leaking toilet the falling fishing reel in the corner the murders are startling and largely unforeseen including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes but who cares it's fun in that simple regard final destination' is my cup of tea this stylishly executed thriller although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side after the show it will also have an frightening impact on you when will your design' expire is death waiting around the corner the final' effect is a major case of the heebiejeebies",

                "in roger michell's romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it's name to the film's title one day american movie superstar anna scott julia roberts walks in to purchase a book on turkey quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an onagain offagain love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat the film opens with a nonverbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such without words this sequence gives us a background to her character following however is a setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning but there it is if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it the film is told nearly first person from william's point of view as he is in every scene by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily in fact much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image william assures her he wouldn't say a word then adds well i'll probably tell myself now and then but i'd never believe it great stuff the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible we're constantly exposed to william's thoughts feelings actions and desires but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times in between this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grant's film hands down he gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior anna doesn't get a lot of our compassion this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast most notable is rhys ifans as spike william's eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh hugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as william's friends and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister's birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst it's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation roger michell's use of visuals doesn't sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type for example there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as william's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air we're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird's eye view of the ground below music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film's scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect it's kind of a mixed bag but still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate notting hill's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it for a couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and that's not so bad now is it",

                "if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures fox searchlight and fine line respectively it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted pleasantville should not be mistaken for a nothought movie quite the opposite is true in fact as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen the story both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation captures the essence of statementmaking in the cinema not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who through quite a bit of luck find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named pleasantville maguire as the reserved bud parker is perfect for the pseudoworld but the rebellious mary sue witherspoon is not at all made for the fatherknowsbest times it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end and begins to teach the townspeople in a quite unlikely way what life is really like soon hues of color creep into the black and white world and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism others fear the strangeness at one end is a soda shop ownerturnedpainter named mr johnson jeff daniels and at the other end is a closeminded mayor j t walsh and his chamber of commerce but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town fine performances are turned in all around maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j t walsh in his latest and final posthumous performance daniels brings an atmosphere of awe inspiration and hope to his character whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy for daniels it's his most commendable performance of the last three years or more and for walsh it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish there's not much to dislike about pleasantville and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't",

                "gothic murdermystery yarns are not a new conceit in fact they've been around in books and on film for many many years without the proper handling they come off as oldfashioned bland and outdated the gift directed by sam raimi is a triedandtrue effort that surprises very little and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond it's fairly obvious who the killer is in fact i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions the film ultimately shouldn't work but it does thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other annie wilson cate blanchett is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale hilary swank who is severely abused by her husband donnie keanu reeves and buddy cole giovanni ribisi an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father for annie she does not give the readings merely for money but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future her late grandmother rosemary harris told her as a child that it was a gift she was given and she should always remember that when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school she meets the niceguy school principal wayne collins greg kinnear whom she finds herself attracted to but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king katie holmes whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about at a party with her best friend linda kim dickens annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan gary cole soon after jessica has disappeared leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale and the pond behind his home the gift may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level but the performances and tight direction from raimi who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film 's for love of the game lift the picture up several notches slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights the disappearance of jessica at the minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut at times frightening horrormystery at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett 's the talented mr ripley who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a runofthemill protagonist into a very exact downtoearth realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing both as a character and an actress blanchett isn't the only bright performer as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year in her first role following her oscar win for 's boys don't cry hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie who seeks guidance from annie but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all to leave the grossly abusive donnie as donnie keanu reeves 's the watcher makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all for the oftencriticized reeves whose acting abilities have never been the best this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get and it is also one of the better performances he has given giovanni ribisi 's the boiler room is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad in the small but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king katie holmes 's wonder boys has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before and she is radiant in her few scenes finally kim dickens 's hollow man makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend linda the other notable aspect of the gift is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it's almost suffocating thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent but one that is filled with dread helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast the gift is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills and offers up a fair share of chills too it may not be groundbreakingly original but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time",
                "with more and more television shows having gay characters and even the infamous ellen sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines the birdcage was critically acclaimed as was this years chasing amy then along came in out and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released it's also noticeable that this alternative lifestyle becomes less and less taboo as the years go by and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort while it's a very serious issue to many it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh at it is more and more becoming something we laugh with and when a movie like in out comes along it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity just as love sex marriage birth death and anything else has been the idea for in out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aidsafflicted gay man in philadelphia if you remember during his acceptance speech hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life it's a serious and touchy subject but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual it may have been more controversial but because it was written by an openly gay writer the prerogative was set kevin kline who only seems to become more and more acclaimed stars as howard brackett a high school english teacher in the small picturesque town of greenleaf indiana after a threeyear engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery joan cusack a wedding date has been set and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story greenleaf high graduate cameron drake matt dillon is up for a best actor oscar the small town eagerly awaits both events and both seem quite astronomical but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other when cameron drake is announced the winner the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher mr brackett everyone is cheering back in greenleaf that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words and he's gay the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop the thing is nobody including howard can understand how cameron came to that conclusion and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee parents debbie reynolds wilford brimley students and the high school's principal tom halliwell bob newhart and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious howard is clean neat honest sincere a romantic and perhaps the most incriminating fact he loves barbara streisand the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and entertainment tonight wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning one particular reporter is peter malloy tom selleck of inside entertainment who unlike the collage of other reporters wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett including coverage of his wedding the intrusion is all but welcome by howard who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute it seems that no matter where he turns a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay it all sounds very devastating and it would be if it weren't presented with nearperfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts kline seems only to improve with age and he is downright perfect here the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine and they use it wonderfully every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever dillon has never been so likeable cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role and brimley reynolds and newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat rudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes while in out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars it remains one of the best done films of the year allaround the script is exuberant the actors are absolutely top notch and we're allowed just the perfect blend of hearttugging so as not to bog down the laughs it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending despite it's subject matter and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex this is a movie that everyone could and should enjoy frank oz best known as a voice talent for muppets directs this film quite delightfully using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer which turns out to be quite a bit check this one out you'll have a gay old time",

                "satirical films usually fall into one of two categories longterm satire where everything including the jokes is somehow related on a large scale i e dr strangelove situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene i e men in black what's unique about wag the dog is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions and yet is both at the same time the result is a clever comedy based on an original smart premise even if the focus does tend to wander a bit if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness in this age of information and technology we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it we need the media to bring us the most uptodate news but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas and then presents an interesting scenario if politics the media coverage of politics and the entertainment industry are so closely related couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all that's the idea conrad brean de niro a professional washington spin doctor comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election brean along with the president's top advisor winifred ames heche fly to california to meet up with hotshot movie producer stanley motss hoffman they pitch him an idea to produce the image of a war with albania it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation such as a folk singer visual and sound effects technicians and a modern style expert known as the fad king leary the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv in the movies or in the news the characters' dialogue is witty and funny although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcomesque for example one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs since it's all computerenhanced anyway she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise but then there's the gags and oneliners that although are humorous seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name or whenever a problem emerges always responding with this is nothing by the time the film makes it to the midpoint everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens the first act is quickly paced while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems headon in realistic manners however it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture what had started off as a brilliant somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie still the situation comedy is quite funny especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt willie schumann a war hero motss and brean concocted truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time but think about afterwards and wag the dog at least succeeds in this respect however in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes then again it's a valiant effort",
                "i know that funnest isn't a word fun is a noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective but that's the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run no wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie i've ever seen so to hell with webster's chicken run is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something living in a concentration camplike atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box one night a brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farm's eggselling plan for a pieselling plan she orders a huge piemaking machine cackling chickens go in pies come out what sort of pies chicken pies of course codirector nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscarwinning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and a close shave the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures part of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and a close shave owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories but in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived now teaming with codirector peter lord park has created a similar creature in chicken run the plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement thing is the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done part of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is but they're chickens so it's funny to us another thing that helps chicken run and most of park's films succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing there are references to the great escape obviously and stalag the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom there's even a nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history the braveheart reference is a hoot if you catch it when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution consider this since july of last year i've seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online out of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome why because once you got past the thought that they're parodying that blair witch' movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose they were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing conversely chicken run doesn't lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene if you've never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun even if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character park lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood and as a result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history but if you've got it chicken run is that much richer the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them ginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it she has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived but sweet poor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners all while perpetually crocheting a sweater and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as a delightful surprise the film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens the animation is firstrate remember that this was all done the oldfashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail as in such topnotch family fare as a bug's life or toy story chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but a active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details anyway the movie's just a boatload of fun funnest damn movie i've seen all

                "curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy but its humour won't appeal to everyone to be specific let me give you an example do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny don't see curdled on the other hand if you found that sequence to be pretty funny you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at our film's heroine gabriela played by angela jones is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles luckily for her miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage her scrapbook is getting pretty big the killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer because he preys on older rich socialite women and he's played by william baldwin this is not a spoiler one particularly striking m o on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests she immediately quits her job and signs on with pfcs which stands for postforensic cleaning service no points for guessing what they do her workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder to them it's just a day job there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk and what they would say gabriela's partner elena played by mel gorham is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wideeyed fascination and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene they're the messiest you see unbeknownst to them the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer so he's also heading over there the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental quentin tarantino executiveproduced this film which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a featurelength film there are other parallels the star of curdled is angela jones the top billing goes to william baldwin but really jones is the central character who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos the deathobssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film curdled jr jones is great in curdled she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wideeyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow it's a great performance reb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever toeing the line between black humour and bad taste the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing any more than that would be a spoiler the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing of course it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously but then again you're not really supposed to braddock knows the audience is in on the joke and makes it a fun little romp as a result the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film and it feels like it the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time and some parts just seem to drag while its running time is already a short minutes it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax it'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well",
                "as fairy tales go cinderella has to be one of the most famous almost everyone knows it well at least in north america so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it it has been done before with varying results this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time the basic story remains unchanged but one thing that seems to vanish with this version and that is all the fantastical elements of the story there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least unlike in the fairy tale the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end the prince' who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france meets 'cinderella' known as danielle on a few occasions most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling the story takes place in a renaissance setting in france with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion this addition of leonardo da vinci was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne the characters of danielle cinderella played by drew barrymore and that of the evil step mother played by anjelica huston are well developed and well played by the two women although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique but anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise all in all this movie takes you back into history into a seemingly magical fairy land but don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing",
                "in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer professor with such livedin naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance ever since wall street douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid's in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a goodnatured veneer but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton douglas played the role straight and out in the open in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force it's simple yet truthful he embodies grady a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms grady points out in his narration that they only do so out of jealousy their target is the very writerly named james leer played by the always understated tobey maguire a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges he's portentous and gloomy as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers though his act is a little too calculated he reminds me of the selfimposed outcast film director jim jarmusch dead man ghost dog whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer exclusively dressed in black and with his spiked hair dyed snow white leer is similar a guy who equates quirks with depth tobey maguire fits well in the role with his round sweeteerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude but unlike cort maguire is easier to warm up to he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility katie holmes plays hannah a beautiful talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants this is a plot line i had trouble with douglas in his old age is beginning to resemble jerry springer a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady maybe it's because i'm jealous and wish holmes was throwing herself at me after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth then i think of douglas's real life companion the breathtaking catherine zeta jones seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas there is a movie in there somewhere grady rather chivalrously if you ask me resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell a droll frances mcdormand who is his age but also married to another professor okay maybe not so chivalrous there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says she was a junkie for the printed word lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice robert downy j r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance the actor is perfectly cast here and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor i wish wonder boys had more of him searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless for it meanders through its running time but that's part of its charm and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia a place i'm greatly fond of and a place rarely explored in american cinema everyone has a subgenre be it war films westerns dance movies that they happen to be privy to i'm privy to films about literary types i e those individuals enthralled by the written word and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters rather than generic mapped out story points sometimes the dialogue is too clever but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted like its characters but as the story progresses it begins to open up for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types and as a lowkey comedy for its chuckleworthy throwaway gags the gags are like those in the great robert altman m a s h the long goodbye movies where jokes exist as asides on the fringes like jokes in life often do the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things curtis hanson who before his last film la confidential toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it an early tom cruise sex comedy and the hand the rocks the cradle has graduated to more meaningful films he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party but in a wonder boys party it fits the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies many will find it slight but i found much to savor among its subtleties",

                "note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned quick robin the antishark repellant adam west in the batman feature film casually kicking at a patheticlooking rubber shark attached to his leg i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness but in many instances batman and robin nears and at some point even exceeds this standard this is a disasterously bad film easily the worst in the series to date and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive it's loud garish and obnoxious with pointless gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill batman and robin features the caped crusaders george clooney debuting as batman with chris o'donnell returing as robin squaring off against another bevy of chemicallyinduced villains the nefarious icecold mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights and the slinky poison ivy uma thurman who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result but whatever and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane jeep swanson a grunting hulk of a beast the villains' goals are noble ones freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife vendela dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth albeit by destroying all human life meanwhile on the homefront life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth michael gough and the arrival of his niece barbara alicia silverstone akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad with astonishingly terrible dialogue lame jokes and an awful bythenumber plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever which i thought was dreadful look positively inspired in comparison i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in no joke an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film even moreso than with his previous batman forever with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo just in case i suppose if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin and with neon prominently figuring in an utterlypointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving latenight motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons mr schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible to the detriment of the story there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between allout camp and heartfelt drama with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered is batman and robin supposed to be campy i think it is it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted bomb each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be i somehow doubt it the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is arnold schwarzenegger is topbilled in the film as the villainous mr freeze and is bland and uninteresting perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be mr schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable frankly everything he does onscreen is laughable by the end of the film i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen the bulk of his performance consists of uttering nearunintelligble puns and oneliners featuring every possible permutation of cool in the least inventive way george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin being overshadowed by the villains and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film his batman is hardly an imposing figure chris o'donnell is unimpressive in a onenote performance while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all the film's one saving grace undoubtably uma thurman's entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy her work in batman and robin is certainly overthetop but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film ms thurman's comic timing is impeccable and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully i'm already starting to positively reassess jim carrey's performance in batman forever her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film and when she's offscreen the film greatly suffers i figure that if one has to die being kissed to death by uma thurman isn't a halfbad way to go while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulsepounding excitement i must admit that i was not bored watching it although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or oneliner and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat it's been a long time since i've laughed so much at a movie at of course is the operative word",

                "i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a superhero been abandoned but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for allout camp with few traces of the selfmocking restraint of the relatively lighthearted third installment let me give you an example in the first scene of the movie batman george clooney and robin chris o'donnell are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger in an attempt to steal a diamond mr freeze's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks but this is no problem for our heroes automatic skates shoot out of their shoes at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick grabs the diamond and stickhandles it through the museum i might have expected this from an airplanestyle farce but i don't think that's what this movie is supposed to be after all the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superheroaction genre and kept the corny deathdefying stunts to a minimum while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony not any more the list goes on and on in this one robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship feet high in the atmosphere climbing in the door to save batman mr freeze and poison ivy uma thurman leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old heman cartoons my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl alicia silverstone gets in a race with motorcycle thugs during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her not bad but wouldn't the police or maybe batman notice if the road was on fire i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place but it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment as if three protagonists and two villains weren't enough batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne's butler alfred michael gough which might have seemed poignant if it wasn't surrounded by so much silliness as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie all this might be semiexcusable if the story were interesting and entertaining but it isn't in fact it's kind of boring mr freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson's joker and danny devito's penguin their evil plot is as predictable schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words today gotham city tomorrow the world as it is lamebrained didn't it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too and robin's constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bullheaded and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place strip away the stars the fancy set design and the status as a batman movie and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick",

                "mandingo has traditionally been seen as one of two things either a muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the words of film critic leonard maltin a trashy potboiler that appeals only to the sm crowd actually i think mandingo is a strange combination of the two although it fails on both fronts it's too trashy to be good drama but too dramatic to be good trash the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king one day in new orleans hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton although the movie never explains it a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley according to the movie mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves meanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild hammond however is happier spending nights with his bed wench the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex it is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love with his bed wench a sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is with blanche hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did of course it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife a white lady had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her so blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping with ellen blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a halfblack child although it's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth and hammond poisons blanche hammond then finds mede shoots him twice in the shoulder and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water yes you read right the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive judging only by the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in th century southern society when mandingo was released in it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs dramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically it's mostly confused if one were to judge history by this film it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality not economics not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working except for a few house servants the men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves but mandingo's overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick although there's plenty of violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure some tried to write off mandingo as a blaxploitation film one of a number of quicklymade lowbudget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies but it's not that easy mandingo was studiofinanced by paramount pictures and produced by dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as the bible the remake of king kong and the illfated dune the director was richard fleischer a veteran who was best known for several special effectsladen action movies including leagues under the sea and fantastic voyage as well as such superior suspense films as the narrow margin the script based on the supermarket bestseller by ken ostott and the subsequent play by jack kirkland was penned by norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on serpico james mason perry king and susan george were wellknown and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career so why is mandingo so bad a number of reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job wexler's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combines stereotyped slavetalk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whut're you gittin' outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed a black brother fleischer's direction is clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nevertheless credit should be given where credit is due despite its exploitative nature mandingo was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery until then there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery even classics such as gone with the wind can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it wasn't all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets but all this is constantly undermined by the film's negligible pointofview it claims to see things from the black perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners with a little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile film while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery it never deals with them the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexler's script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does it steven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindler's list by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid the difference between that film and mandingo is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma mandingo is satisfied to simply show some skin and because of that its trashy

                "keep cool a chinese film directed by semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival on the day it premiered lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater they need not have wasted their time the movie is billed as a comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor there are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few tries actually click i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either keep cool just isn't very funny the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who with the help of an interpreter regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii although the print made it the assistant's luggage was lost too bad that story wasn't in the movie because it got a big laugh qu ying the film's female lead was also on hand to give a few comments however whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed ms ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one fastpaced incredibly long tirade it was dizzying good foreshadowing for the film you see keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes at least that's the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving cinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing i found it thoroughly distracting and after a while quite annoying headache as i said the film is about a young bookseller wen jiang who is after a young woman qu ying they used to be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship the first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back of course the thing is she doesn't want to be won back and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit in the fight the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced there is a funny scene the only one in the film where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order to recoup his losses there is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character the bookseller would be better off without her although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time a friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate although only an hour and a half in length keep cool contains extraneous material the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we don't see her from the midpoint on a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half but of course this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour there are a few things that keep cool does right as mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good although it grows tiresome the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic and represents the differences in thinking between generations in one scene for example the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted and that it means something entirely different also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner the nightclub owner is counting out money slapping each bundle of currency on the table with every shot of his hand we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge unfortunately these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater",

                "when the haunting arrived in theaters all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terrors and it was about as scary as a dust bunny so special effects or not if the story isn't the least bit scary you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern dern is always great and even though he may have had only about minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie as i sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goingson catherine zetajones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects like the original taylor's character is the star of the movie but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms zetajones their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original and let's face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zetajones i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients there really isn't much of a story here just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with and the special effects are great in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shots quota at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary funny maybe but not scary then we have the set when i first saw the house i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did and decided to take the idiotically overdone route this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves what part did these rooms play in the story absolutely none they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie then we have the actors lili taylor has never been one of my favorites and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she comes in around the average or slightly below mark i have no idea why liam neeson took this role he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman zetajones was cast because she is too hot for words the fact that her character is bisexual is just icing on the cake all catherine has to do in this movie is look good fortunately that is something she does very well while she does have a fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eyecandy it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role the haunting is the antithesis of another of 's horror movies the blair witch project the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film if the story sucks it's all downhill from there my advice if you are looking for special effects go rent star wars if it's scares you want rent halloween either way it's probably in your best interests to skip the haunting",

                "you know i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man while watching instinct i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the wellexplored themes of those earlier movies even beside the tarzan comparison instinct just isn't a very good film it's painfully idealistic manipulative and silly i didn't hate it it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins furthermore most of the acting is quite good but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams things start off in the predictable way as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero theo caulder cuba gooding jr an ambitious young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced old psychiatrist donald sutherland caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life the one he thinks will make him famous the subject is ethan powell hopkins an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial through a series of short sessions caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell even though it really is an old man version of tarzan much of this central idea is rather interesting as i said hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas the character himself isn't very interesting he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action gooding jr does strong work opposite hopkins playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual the screenplay written by gerald di pego and suggested by a novel by daniel quinn gives us no background information on caulder but that seems to be the point he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work nonetheless these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct unfortunately filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure for they work together to make the dumbest most clicheridden environment in which their characters are to live and they do so by means of brainless subplots first we have the prison warden subplot the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost if this means taking caulder off the powell case then that's fine there's also the prison guard subplot the prison guard is played by john ashton the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion then there's the daughter subplot in which maura tierney playing the daughter must look very upset a lot of the time after all she is the daughter of a deranged man if some of this stuff sounds familiar that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had ashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs and then there's the whole tarzan thing which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the halfhearted attempt at philosophical depth the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one he thinks that humans are takers that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas i can sympathize with that but only when it's in a compelling film this is the kind of stupid movie just like patch adams in which a big group of characters psychotic inmates in this case rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor we would have had a thirtyminute movie far superior to the twohour one that i watched today if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise then we would really have had something interesting a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors",

                "prereview note seeing as the only concern of body shots is sex i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review because of this i will try to vary word descriptions of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend fret not it's most likely just another way of referring to sex i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack it's about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it these are things we all do sometimes the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts their lives center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek at its core body shots is a message movie the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition michael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil is a moralist with nothing new to say his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera they voice simplistic platitudes like i like to come or sex without love equals violence huh and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get the characters are stupid and shallow with not one registering as anything more the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such events we meet the characters as they speak directly to us confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them giving you the pros and cons but for this film i cannot i'm not trying to be clever or witty but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others with the exception of trent played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other a patchwork of fake breasts defined abs pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one only because his character gets the worst lines sex without love equals violence in between all the confessionals cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f kobsessed fine i don't have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way but cristoffer only gives us one side additionally that one side isn't even entertaining the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness or realism one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other alas if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isn't it erotic it isn't real it doesn't feel like an authentic sexual encounter every f k scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serves me i can't think of one film that has done so and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 's next to wall street unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care not the writer the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious spin off paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here though boogie nights succeeded it was similarly moralistic but it gave us two different viewpoints it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters and it showed us the possible fallout of such a decision the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here but anderson seemed to care about them he gave them heart cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones he preaches to us by using his characters to preach to us this is not the way to get any message across why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin' skins cristofer kind of does that though without an ounce of insight and with a helping of leering exploitation",

voyage to rio on a raft while several clips of the film are seen the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it despite studio problems a staggering workload and extremely ill fortune on the set impressive photography but really only interesting to film historians sadie thompson u s a director raoul walsh screenwriter raoul walsh from the john colton play rain based on w somerset maugham's story miss thompson cast gloria swanson raoul walsh lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newlyrestored version of frank capra's lost horizon where several scenes had been restored using stills i was interested to see sadie thompson where the last minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story miss thompson this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seenlittle awkwardness and a very clever script the actors gloria swanson raoul walsh who also directed and wrote the screenplay and especially lionel barrymore as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul but really wants to get her between the sheets is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel swanson adds real life to the character adding an worldly affectionate air to the bawdy sadie unfortunately the ending is rather poorly tied up it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of liveaction film or the original script the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for still it's entertaining right up to the end certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance which nonetheless works perhaps due to the silent screen is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells bakkers and robertses of the religious worlds a c movie worth if you can find it the pied piper czechoslovakia director jim barta screenwriter kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate and with a lot of political comment along with it perhaps economic content is a better wordit certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light nor human nature nor anything else for that matter as you may have guessed this is not a tgif film this is the kind of film you are glad is over not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons this is stopanimation that is very well done all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnutsexcept for the animated stuffed rats boy sounds like a real comedy vehicle doesn't it add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison and you have something to give the wee ones and some of the mentally unstable larger folk to keep them up at night

everett hugo weaving arthur dignam jennifer claire catherine mcclements after a lifetime of moviegoing and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival i've learned several rules which while not absolute should certainly be given deference to be wary of french comedies these people like jerry lewis ken russell is never going to grow up no matter how long you wait any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as old poutylips is probably not worth watching when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography watch out australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo but since weir and miller left for foreign shores finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult not impossiblewitness malcolm last year task well i ignored rules last night and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 's about tragedy among the gentry and falling in love with people below your station and horses lots and lots of horses the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir unfortunately said son a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident highlights include the amputation sequence the doctor's daughter who has the hots for the son tasting his urine for a diagnosis their tender kissing with a

                "watching the movie i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup cute 'n cuddly computergenerated monkey if the monkey died the movie got an extra half star alas the monkey showed up at the end unharmed to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs what that means is that lost in space actually deserved stars that's pretty generous considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek when will robinson jack johnson teaches his pet robot about friendship you are actually supposed to buy it so why such a seemingly high rating there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage first we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater the sound and screen kicked ass nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way also there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons or getting caught up in the movie's tension i even liked the computergenerated settings i usually prefer to see models or sets but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities also gary oldman is never a bad actor even though he is typecast as a villain william hurt isn't too bad either neither actor had a great role but their performances were watchable and perhaps i shouldn't admit this but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood there is very little swearing or blood there is a strong moral message saccharine though it is there is a bit of romance whose culmination after hours is a real kiss no sex it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six those movies were probably as bad as lost in space but at the time they were manna from heaven that type of moviemaking is a lost art now for the bad news worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue it's squeakyclean family fun trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction you better hold on to your joystick is one such line and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign second worst and closely related is the screenplay the story's exposition takes place at a press conference which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity effort or interest once the story gets going i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while but on the whole the situations that arise are silly and contrived when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons my friend summed it up perfectly he flipped the switch to 'evil ' then there's the tone of the movie the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson then it could be an adventure movie they're mostly right except that johnson will wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off still that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a promise keepers notion of who's the center of a family many quality family films have been made with a nontraditional family structure fly away home comes to mind to much better effect and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie in star wars the rebels were the good guys we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system in lost in space the rebels are the bad guys a terrorist force that must be killed crushed and silenced so that our children may live free that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists finally a few specific details deserve criticism the movie tells us that the setting is the year why why bother saying what year this is just tell us it's the future i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless not that this movie was really in the running anyway then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed it made lost in space look cool the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and out of context made it sound hip this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie but if that's the best part of the movie i can't in good conscience recommend it still if you get stuck seeing it as we did you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance think of liking bad movies as a child and bring along your bad movie bingo cards",

                "if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it if that were true i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads shay casey seeing bad movies so you don't have to but i know that's bunkyou're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say so i have to tell the truth every once in a while i get a nasty masochistic urge to see a bad movie you know the feeling when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly sometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies ever admit it sometimes you like seeing bad movies so do i so i saw supernova truth be told supernova wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be maybe i just felt sorry for the actors or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's walter hill final cut causing him to want his name removed maybe i'm becoming a softy in any case i didn't find supernova as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe but it's still bad the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale the crew includes captain a j marley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz there are some attempts at characterization but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction which puts kaela on edge yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissyfaces at each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay is in love with the computer apparently female don't expect any more explanation because you won't get it anyway the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent during the dimension jump i think that's what it's called but don't hold me to it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board he calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening have you seen alien have you seen event horizon a lame movie in its own right good then you've seen supernova postproduction cuts or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either after all no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain but the bigger problem with supernova is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded numerous rewrites the script may be credited to three people but it's a gross underestimate have crammed this lean minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot did the ship's computer learn something about humanity what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him and just what does the film's title signify if anything as far as i can tell it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements character relationships in this film also make very little sense for some reason every person in this film keeps having sex we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first minutes bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later they're engaging in some hankypanky when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship of course both female crew members will fall in love with him every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut the most prominent example however may be the fact that when the film starts there are no opening credits furthermore the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene with littletono introduction to any of the characters or situations the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point a to point b point a danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby point b tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing doesn't make sense since i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone and he does knocking off three of them in about minutes not a whit it's a shame because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do they don't find it bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same

whole lot less nice not that we ever find out who that is mind you the climax of their relationship taking place in a transport pod is probably the film's biggest foreheadslapper as troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected he' s awfully onenote but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with the rest of the cast does even less tunney stands around looking cute then scared phillips broods cruz flirts with the computer then they all die and a star blows up or something but i really wasn't paying much attention by then supernova is pretty awful but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got that's it if you expect it to be good for whatever reasons you may have you'll probably hate it more than i will even the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven' t seen before and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film honestly though what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym it usually results in a bad movie and that's what supernova is",

                "there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strongworded attack on a group of stoic doctors when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture you see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it and i actively hate it now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories i hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey the badness of patch adams is stupefying it's confounding i can't believe a film can be this bad and yet it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make in the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human in the beginning of the film patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself while there he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings so patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients he goes to medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that it's good to help people he also meets carin fischer monica potters the antimale med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor naturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants to thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have and that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of on a superficial level the film is not particularly bad i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for i actually liked potter's performance even if she is wasted but the film fails fundamentally in execution every scene swells with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard take for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting on a bus we don't know patch yet but there's sad music and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad later on patch makes a lot of progress he helps a dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively and when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions real drama is characterbased you grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it we don't ever grow to know the dying patient he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness real drama doesn't seem forced or present just to make the audience cry that's why patch adams is not real drama it goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score sentimentality like this is indeed bad but it's not as bad as halfbaked simplistic themes you see patch is a really great student he aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor why don't we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds well patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort most of us have to study and a doctor who really wants to help but doesn't know a toe from a finger probably won't be too successful in preventing death oh wait i almost forgot the point of doctors is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life yes that is true and you can not do that without studying you can not do that without going to medical school what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later follow the rules bah who needs the rules only uptight doctors follow the rules the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants and then there's the free clinic issue which i find shockingly frighteningly idealistic a free clinic in the middle of the forest where patients can be taken to be helped for free how will patients be transported to the free clinic will it have an emergency room or is it just for mental patients and who may i ask will pay for it the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent reader please understand this i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams i know nothing about him if his beliefs mirror those of this film character then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them but regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony and in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus patch does a lot of shouting actually robin williams does a lot of shouting he shouts a lot about helping people and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words i won't tell you that you can't be moved by his words because i too was moved by his words i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be patch adams is the cheapest of them all",

                "since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 's steven spielberg drama schindler's list and directed 's intelligent searching for bobby fischer his new film a civil action should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career what doesn't make sense is how such highprofile and superb actors as john travolta robert duvall william h macy and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project which is both dull and completely ineffective the film which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia certainly contains the type of story to be emotionallycharged but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings leaving us with nothing more than a poorlydone courtroom drama based on a book by jonathan hart which was consequently based on a true account a civil action is set in in the town of woburn mass where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann john travolta decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes jan originally decides to drop the case but when he stumbles across to corporate giants grace and beatrice foods who have plants located near the families' homes he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which thus goes into the city's drinking water suddenly after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery even though he is warned by his staff accountant william h macy that no money is coming in to them only going out also figuring into the story is jerome facher robert duvall beatrice foods' corporate counsel who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his million offer to settle the case coming from such a talented writer director and cast not to mention one of the most interesting film composers danny elfman a civil action is an astoundingly emptyheaded drama one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning watching the film i couldn't help but notice its similarities with 's far far superior film the sweet hereafter which dealt with a lawyer played brilliantly by ian holm investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident holm interviews the grieving parents as well as the sole surviving passenger a teenage girl which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter a young drugaddict who has run away from home not only was the plotting similar to a civil action but it also had the same exact running time of minutes considering this it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful a sweet hereafter was not only concentrating on the school bus accident but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons as well as the teenage girl in a civil action however i have no idea where the running time went since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness we do not get to know the parents very well nor any of the main characters through its whole duration i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta's lawyer character jan schlictmann who doesn't appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job every scene is tediously related directly to the premise and therefore there was no one for me to care about or root for you've got to work pretty hard actually to not get an audience to become involved in the parents' plight since their children are dead but that is exactly what a civil action does to be honest i would be fairly hardpressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked aside from one flashback to when a man's young son died on the way to the doctor i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes and more than once found my mind wandering i could say the performances were good but who's fooling who since every character is onedimensionally written no one's acting abilities are challenged in any way travolta plays a lawyer well enough but that's about all he does duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role apparently only appearing to give oneliners at every chance he gets and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture's final scene as a judge she appears unbilled since it is just a cameo but why did she even agree to do it in the first place finally when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role the film left me with another question what was the point abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum where none came before that to begin with a civil action seemed to me at least to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with",

                "some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time playing god asks just one simple eensy teensy thing so it can fully entertain you it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps crack open your skull scoop out your brain squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one congratulations you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie others are simply good ideas that are badly executed then there's playing god which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of ripoffs or homages as they like to call it from other better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet harsh maybe justified hell yes this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes for example a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away this does look moderately kool but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling oooh look look john woo two guns blazing slooooow motion and if that wasn't enough you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines you have to admire the effort he puts into it this guy deserves better unlike most movies this one does not suffer from stupid bad guy syndrome just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes example duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages now the bad guy is like stoned man so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero term used as loosely as possible survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun which our hero does but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger mind you i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs be he stoned or not some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct the hell with that two fbi guys have just been shot in front me along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second solution boom i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers he still has his shotgun bring it along you say no thanks i'll just ditch it in the back of my car and the real kicker is this when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised while we are on the subject of getting shot why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door i've got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door ask mr wild bill the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life this is the major problem with this movie any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters for instance our heroes hide at duchovny's summer home now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment ok this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time but see our hero is a drug addict and guess what he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt oh sure he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling going clean is really honorable of him but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton plot holes the size of godzilla getting our intelligence insulted and several oh come on moments",
                "the following review contains some harsh language but what did you expect when you clicked on this title cast kristen holly smith danica sheridan alex boling michael dotson sonya hensley janet krajeski sabrina lu dionysius burbano calvin grant jeff b harmon written and directed by jeff b harmon running time minutes the thought of losing you makes me all vomity inside blatz balinski danica sheridan laments the fact that her lesbian lover april kristen holly smith has just received a telegram from her exfiance isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot smith a resident of the small town of bumfuck arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson michael dotson when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home sticks a gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger instead of killing herself she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed except for lance the homosexual toilet cleanerslave april loves her new home and friends but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up mr and ms pfferpot director jeff b harmon and janet krajeski decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr sigmoid colon also jeff b harmon who claims he can cure homosexuality in actuality dr colon is homosexual as well and begins his special treatment on dick dickson unbeknownst to dick when april turns down dick's demand for her to return to bumfuck he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambostyle instead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance alex boling and the two of them along with april and her lover blatz get married note to the filmmaker why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided april's parents feeling like there is no recourse call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer their way the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the circuitry and they rewire it and send it back to washington d c destroying it mr and ms pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own i'm not sure if writerdirectorcostar jeff b harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs either way he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie the film opens with a preacher running a small africanamerican child out of town and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan during a jaunty musical number preceded by remarks about gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others such as the jews if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent as for the entire central theme of the movie i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get i tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of nonacceptance i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me again maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully as far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy despite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day speaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells ain't ringing could have been a decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying i'm a lesbian which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms smith it's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based the other performers are decent save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan i have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired one particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my filmgoing life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented antinukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film once the isle of lesbos reprise was reached i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indieunderground com the transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately in many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like a rocky horror for the new millennium this film is by no means my cup of tea but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it if you think it might be for you then by all means seek it out i on the other hand will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator wait aren't gladiator films considered to be oh never mind",

                "topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil's advocate movies that have a brilliant beginning but don't know how to end it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other there is liz who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment prue who is getting married geoff liz's boyfriend neil her previous boyfriend ant who has written a screenplay for the first hour we get to know these people through everyday activities as they talk on the phone go out to dinner hang clothes on the line the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the filmmakers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them at times the events border on the ridiculous like the screening of the film but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained with about half an hour to go a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama such a disappointment after such a brilliant start the actors are all quite good with ms danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock up till that point i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility it's unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film not just the events but also the tone of some of the end is wrong clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film as stated above the first hour is superb and even the end is above average it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss",

                "well there goes another one sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad and well i guess i was right with bad excuses for acting a horrible screenplay and straightout bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date here is the stupid plot chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend he meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three years jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her what he wants i never did catch so he proposes in a really bad way and she shoots him down and is very mad he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie million dollars as long as he marries before the next day at pm now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her or get married to someone else to get the money itself leading to an unfunny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs even the supporting roles of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good the plot was a good idea but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming sweet and likable performance as usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a bigheaded mogul who after a while became routine and old one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before it's not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness 'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first minutes gets annoying and old artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and unnerving why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts its based on the silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess even though some may think of this as a good date movie most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back besides being a terrible movie 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times the running time of the movie is minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time being one of the worst movies of the year we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and if they do they i give up on filmmakers",
                "i wont even pretend that i have seen the other alien films i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after minutes of painful viewing but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning sigourney weaver whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination plays the character of ripley who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien years later scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley including the alien that was stuck inside her in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two yet ripley is now not completely human possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so but for now well just ignore it and move on why you ask would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated well the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research they yawn were wrong it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary unflossed teeth theres a little saying that goes something like this if youre going to make a bad film do it well i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies but they are not the ones that really bother me alien resurrection a good example of a film that really gets up my nose is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore which attempts to distract us from the wanderingbutnotgoinganywhere plot in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story but this is unfortunately not the case and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film then you thought right one exciting scene is a credit and the only part remotely worth seeing to the film in which an alien chases two men one a cripple up a tall ladder with interesting results but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent its no wonder why alien resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is oh and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies the less i enjoy a film the more i eat so all the lollies were gone in minutes but however empty the bag turned out to be it was still a long way ahead of the movie",
                "well what are you going to expect it's a movie about a big snake that eats people that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more instead i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me too anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river led by anthropologists dr steven cale eric stolz and terri flores jennifer lopez the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives along the way they find poacher paul sarone jon voight and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers i don't know what is at the beginning of anaconda we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past but that seems to be more or less over now i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line but it ended up being a setup for nothing cale chokes on a deadly wasp don't ask me how that happens i don't know and is put out of action relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake however this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle most bad characters are either annoying or stupid in this movie they're both since this description applies to all the characters except sarone it's hard to find someone to root for you're supposed to back the good guys but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else at times i almost found myself rooting for the snake there are no standout performances here everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason no matter as in most monster movies the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway in most of the scenes the snake is computer generated and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real however the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences sometimes for example the snake just moves too fast it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall for crying out loud then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly absolutely ridiculous a testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is in a scene totally unrelated to anything else we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard one of the panther's eyeballs pops out eeeewwwww above and beyond the sick factor however this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed in films like these a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown in a case like that the showdown just ends up being a letdown when i saw the snake for the first time i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger this one was just a decoy and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe no such luck okay maybe anaconda is actually a decoy and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut",

                "i've always been a kevin kline fan silverado fish called wanda pirates of penzance and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances the minute i saw the trailer for this film i resolved to see it besides the fact that kline starred it looked like a hilarious film i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent however as i also thought wow if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film oops i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo my name for our local multimultiplex the film began the film concerns an englishdrama teacher at a suburban high school named howard brackett he loves poetry and great literary works but his class is more interested in his famous former student played by matt dillon i'd put in his name but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him brackett has been engaged to another teacher played by joan cusack for three years and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her the wedding however becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual kline spends most of the first twothirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference his closest friends don't help matters bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party there are some genuinely hilarous moments one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows if you want to be surprised don't read i am going to reveal the ending instead of saying i do in front of his parents and most of the town and even some cameras he says i'm gay this is where the movie in my opinion falls apart most of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight while at the same time loving poetry and being a senstivie guy dressing well and occaisionally acting prissy it reminded me of the effeminate heterosexual sketch from saturday night live it was funny it was sustainably funny and kline's performance made it doubly so however after the wedding the film drags on they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done he reconciles with his parents and his friends some of which had turned on him there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time the scene with his mother and her friends which was hilarious seemed pointless and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless finally even though i am not catholic i found the scene with the priest to be condescending the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship proclaiming to brackett in the third person he's gay it got a chuckle from the audience but i was distracted by it and began to tire of the film by the time the wedding had come and gone i found myself hoping it would be over soon much like this review you are saying overall if i have to quantify it i say rising action gets and climax and falling action gets see it in economy time",
                "something is fishy in the state of universal about ten years back with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior postapocalypse nittygritty survival yarns became popular at the movies we've always had movies of this nature on the beach the end of the world damnation alley the ultimate warrior and so on to date the most smoothly done were straightforward haircuts of the classic western plot like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization usually one in possession of some critical resource like water feed range or a mining claim most of these grew out of venerable but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn which was fairly well made on a small budget now we have waterworld which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter well she's not a widow and the kid isn't her daughter but you get the idea the lady is helen played by the stunning jean tripplehorn who isn't given a chance to be stunning or even interesting by the mediocre and unimaginative script the child enola played by tina majorino is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie she outshines her material all the way through in simple the scene is earth hundreds of years from now the polar ice caps have melted and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies and survive by trade theft or piracy somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries and its inhabitants called smokers are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials so the bad guys have outboard engines and fastmoving boats airplanes and jet skis enola found at sea as a young girl has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical dryland the place where trees crops and animals grow and what plot there is hinges on who has enola the psycho ruler of the smokers the deacon is trying to get her and find his way to dryland played with typical selflampooning rugchewing histrionics by dennis hopper deacon is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing his performance is almost laughable but there just isn't enough there to be funny the star and a coproducer is kevin costner he's playing an unnamed lone denizen of the sea a man called the mariner who turns out to be a gilled waterbreathing mutant with webbed feet very little is done with this the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted much of the earth's surface would still be above water and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown canned meat does not last for centuries ammunition does not fire after it's more than a few decades old and so on and so on i'm quite fond of tina majorino's previous work very impressed by jean tripplehorn's past accomplishments and still speechless over costner's dances with wolves but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it this movie cost one hundred and eightytwo million dollars and there's nothing in it we haven't seen before done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey at minutes of material this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make the budget of this movie could have given us over thirty movies it could have paid for six years of a primetime sf tv series with expensive fx work or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx in sum this movie is beneath contempt it has nothing new to offer it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation if you have to go see it see it on a fourdollar matinee otherwise you'll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface for weeks",

                "warning spoilers are included in this review but it doesn't really make much of a difference deep impact begins the official summer movie season and it also brings back memories of remember when dante's peak came out in february a few months later volcano was released the first film was smart exhilirating and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent well it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition this time unfortunately the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon the upcoming cometdisaster to be released the beginning of july of course the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine and so i am in the minority as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak but while watching deep impact i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film apparently many did and it utterly baffles me to be completely honest i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo but it was still rather fun to watch deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities it also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects and a poorly constructed plot the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters deep impact begins in an unnamed year the year varies advanced technology sets it in the future but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater pushing it back to a line of students is outside at night peering through telescopes at the dark sky above among these are leo biederman elijah wood and sarah hotchner leelee sobieski leo unknowingly discovers a comet and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds he races off to mail the information but is killed in a reckless car accident a year passes and nothing is heard about it again we are then introduced to jenny lerner t a leoni a reporter for msnbc she gets handed a job to investigate a possible coverup in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse james cromwell she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie after talking with rittenhouse and unsatisfied with the information she gets she decides to use the internet for help luckily she knows exactly how to spell the certain ellie that she is looking for they spell it ele in the film that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled before she can use the information the government decides to push her car off the road they take her in to meet the president of the united states president beck morgan freeman beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference naturally she wants to be compensated and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question and so yada yada yada they reveal the comet to the public and their plans send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive they announce a plan called ark which is their only hope for survival a computer will select people at random these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race after two years the dust will settle actually it would take much much longerapproximately ninety years from what i understand and the humans could come back to the surface and start over the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures but there is one subplot worth mentioning jenny and her father jason maximilian schell have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt now of course we all know that the comet does impact the surface the title alone suggests it and the previews actually show it by doing this absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show er her major film debut was the peacemaker a pathetic and heartless action film well this time leder outdid herself creating a film worse than that one suggestion to ms leder please stay away from the big screen or at least the action genre much of the blame can be placed on leder directly because the pace is disastrously off throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed it goes from months to weeks to hours it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in realtimeit's that boring of course leder isn't all to blame for it screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time what starts out promising soon turns deadly for the audience anyway chock full of cheesy one liners you know you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school and stupid characters you might think we were back in the s again only one of the subplots is remotely interesting while the rest are forgettable and boring and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action drama or scifi to put it simply the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation that's right miss and hit scenes above the earth are well done and the orbiting ship is majestic but the comet is a huge mistake making it more laughable than frightening the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough but that's forgiveable what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface give me a break will ya and of course the much hyped collision of comet and earth well it is far from spectacular and it makes independence day look brilliant the water rushing towards the land is effective but once it hits the continent the effects turn ridiculous cgi water is used and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks in fact i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days just when we think visual effects can't be improved along comes a film to show that they really can and should be one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction which also influences the actors leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror this reminded me of another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces but instead of coming off as sympathetic leder seems more of a sadist one moment has an astronaut flying off into space this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience and i for one am not going to be fooled on another note leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts the pace does pick up and some very emotional moments are shown then again when you watch people cry for their loved ones it's obvious it will be emotional it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into feeling for the characters but it didn't work for me but anyway the actors do as much as they can with what they are given t a leoni bad boys tv's the naked truth is the best of the film and she is given the meatiest role her character is made stronger by leoni's presence and we grow to care for her robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch but his character is turned into shreds by the plot elijah wood also comes off rather successfully but he still hasn't had many good roles wood stick to drama you are too talented for this stuff vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen maximilian schell is distracting but he does provide some nice humor morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this and gives one of his most shallow performances to date which is quite remarkable for him leelee sobieski could have been better but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby eldard is good in his role but is limited by the plot crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's star trek the next generation seeing her was one of the highlights of the film overall a very talented cast virtually wasted deep impact is rated pg for disaster related elements and brief language this is one of the worst films of the year and if it is any omen of things to come this summer could be one of the worst ever luckily the xfiles movie is coming up and hopefully armageddon will be more successful it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much costing nearly million with special effects done by the illustrious ilm which is a huge shocker and with a score composed by oscarwinner james horner titanic one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience well it's not when the comet does hit the earth you almost wish it could just take this film along with it",

                "sometimes when i decide to write a short story or a poem i think of a title first and then think of a subject to go with it it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it the title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before the picture even began of course my attention dwindled shortly into the film disturbing behavior like so many thrillers starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex it's a suspense film with no suspense it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of it's a disaster a listless and uninspired disaster that just barely misses onestardom because of a few good sequences a mercifully short running time and one terrific set of opening credits our main man is a fellow named steve clark blandly played by jimmy marsden he moves to a small town with his family after tragically his brother shoots himself steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother we learn this through strange homevideo like nightmares that he has occasionally the big trial for steve is of course to fit in at school and make new friends marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject as a social reject he falls in with some pretentious dopesmoking philosophers gavin nick stahl and rachel katie holmes gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks known as the blue ribboners are actually a bunch of zombies assimilating new members into their group while sporadically killing innocent people so it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to solve the mystery and do something about it by the end of it all something has happened and things have been explained but the film still doesn't make any sense disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg i've seen his name around recently he was one of the toucheruppers on the armageddon script and i imagine that for the most part he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting he did however have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film and then decided to actually take the time to write it out evil small town films are pretty common the last one phantoms is also a dismal failure but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work rosenberg's script is a complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization and it makes no sense nor is their any purpose when things are finally explained there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks but the film never explains exactly what is happening they get strapped to chairs a microchip is inserted into their eyes and poof they become sexcrazed superviolent machinelike creatures the doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the film much of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act in one terrible scene gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques while pointing them out in the cafeteria up front i should say that in four years of high school i did not eat in the cafeteria even once that aside the various social groups he points out are general uninteresting and poorlyshown for instance he points to the nerds who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered most of the dialogue is forced no one says bite me anymore and none of the scenes have any degree of wit this picture is not inspired and most scenes flop from one to the other with no sense of momentum or energy the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently likes his films dry horror films should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid there are a few good scenes though such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the film for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn i also liked the school janitor character played by william sadler he has a few lines that are surprisingly thoughtprovoking the acting is largely a waste of talent marsden is as i said bland thought not particularly bad bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted stahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction isn't good enough to hone in on their skills stahl's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cutouts of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn't all that cool disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film and it started out a wreck before shooting even began i'm surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film or that it would make a lot of money at the box office it's not boring or even blatantly awful but it's an uninspired lump of a film it sure starts off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable so if you go to see this film take my advice appreciate the credit sequence and pray it never ends",

                "while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation we had yet another shoddy subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks and once again we have one of the worst films of the year the trend of the moment and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie is spawn and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment he's been sent to hell todd mcfarlane the creator of the spawn comic book must have had a tough time sitting through spawn for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects style over substance ambience over anything else not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects the story about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of bad guys and find himself in the process is realized in such a sordid incapable manner it becomes indigestible after a while every character in this film is lifeless vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student the story begins like in every superhero movie in this age with a man living an idyllic life al simmons michael jai white a government agentassassin shares the love of his wife wanda theresa russell and daughter has a tongueincheek wiseass partner terry d b sweeney and is content with the job his boss jason wynn martin sheen provides him the next element in the film is the part when things go awry and as expected everyone turns the tables on poor al as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant al is befriended by jason and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene inevitably it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away hence jason's mischievous mastermind plan to conquer the world is just commencing its initial stages when al makes a pact with satan himself agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again so our pal al has been uplifted to hell and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife time passes and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city the ghetto where cog nicol williamson teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts his motorbike armor etc this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla now the stage is set spawn the new enemy of evil' vs evil and evil takes the cake doubtlessly john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point all this anguish pain halfbaked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo who steals the show and derives joy from his character which is basically a compilation of soso one liners and then there's martin sheen whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent as the megalomaniac boss his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a bmovie scrambled and left in the shelf to rot this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street i'd never thought i'd be saying this but at this juncture charlie sheen's career is in better shape spawn is a movie in which realism or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling jumping through roofs and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie a very bad superhero movie continually the film kept on depending on special effects and sadly this is how pictures are being made perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting it is perceptible that director mark dippe attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act but bruce wayne had human elements to him he was pensive resourceful and had relationships which made our perspective on him equally human the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change as if he's fatigued about being normal and as all superheroes batman superman the phantom they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary none of this is present in spawn the fighting sequences are weakly executed the dialogue is pennydreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's as an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten and then rescued by spawn so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic admittedly i did laugh once in the film and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn movies that present no admiration no captivation no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to and kids will continue to see films like spawn simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one children are not muppets and spawn unapologetically targets children",

                "in the continuation of warner brother's franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film avika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as the client is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl who just happens to be alfred's niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little subplot escapes me if mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth this is indeed a cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she joins with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the characters have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workmanlike is to be generous his best performances are still on e r bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now he's just a spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense chris o'donnell once considered a rising star successfully burns up on reentry with this performance his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking the less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings us to the villains arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freeze's imprisonment the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film it's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor ones have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it's tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows gwaaaa's and clang's associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film the special effects by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary stars of this film and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivy's lair the batcave to freeze's hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is a good director one just has to look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin comes off as a mated made for tv movie the film has no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jello pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even with it's surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner's thought tim burton would do with the franchise kill it joel schumacher's batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately boring stars",

                "i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick take the professional for example it boasts extremely glossy cinematography a couple of recognizable name actors and a couple of fairly impressive explosions it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features a central relationship between a middleaged man and a twelveyearold girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension the professional is all over the map and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon jean reno brutally efficient but also very isolated one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door her name is matilda natalie portman and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d e a agent norman stansfield gary oldman after matilda's father tried to rip him off leon reluctantly takes matilda in then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother the two become closer which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much and sets out to eliminate them both writerdirector luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita a slick potboiler about a female assassin there is no question that besson can make a great looking film with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast he has created a film chock full of moody closeups and evocative lighting but beneath the shiny wrapper there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits all intended to show us that for a hired killer he's really not so bad a guy he drinks lots of milk takes meticulous care of a potted plant and enjoys gene kelly movies jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality but she doesn't have too much to work with either besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag wildeyed and way over the top but at least he is interesting to watch there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional which isn't always a problem in an action thriller except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelveyearold in a really distasteful way there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship confront it head on or ignore it entirely but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a mm pistol or the blood which is spilled aplenty a great deal of the time the professional is just plain sleazy and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact",

                "synopsis sullen julie james still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from i know what you did last summer perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas arriving at the start of the hurricane season julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand comments i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i halfpaid attention to while watching the tube party of five i do know however seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre neve campbell scream queen of the s and star of scream scream and the craft is a regular of the show so too is jennifer love hewitt lo and behold following in the footsteps of campbell hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own the i know what you did last summer line though the original film released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout jennifer love hewitt is a very goodlooking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles with acting she just isn't convincing in this film and she wasn't in the original either this puts many young males including myself in a paradoxical quandary she's very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girltype character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize exploitatively her figure add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason i still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses nothing else here is original or interesting this movie in fact makes other recent soso horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches an isolated location a storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots of bluelighted darkness scenes a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook they may as well have huge targets painted on them like scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief unfortunately i still know's characters aren't all that funny in particular one character a chainweedsmoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough the death scenes by the way are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film several of them are uncomfortable to watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser bloodline a truly sadistic movie this too did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for and what is the deal with the slasher himself i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror come on the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate though his lightninglit appearances ellicited muchneeded laughter in the theater his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film and that's really saying something so all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy both prance about in tightfitting revealing outfits or in various states of undress yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene hewitt however does do a postshower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite titillating this scene alone made this onestar turkey earn two stars under my rating system otherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves early in the film for instance brandy wins the trip to the bahamas she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever i needed extrastrength tylenol after that part oh and the film's conclusion talk about repetitive people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least minutes before it happens boring i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater admission is only one dollar on wednesdays and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them it's usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience who don't seem to mind participating in a mass mystery science theater type viewing i still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad it really is if it weren't for the main actresses' revealing wardrobes i'd have had a very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel i can't imagine trying to watch it on video horror films seem times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and wouldn't recommend it to people unless they're horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works what a depressing thought hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act rated r this film contains lots of violence several gory scenes and a couple nubile horny teenagersthough the sex act itself is always thwarted i'd say this is unsuitable for kids but teens wouldn't have a problem sitting through it especially since they obviously compose the film's target audience",

cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse this being nothing like the pulseemitting monolith in that one was on the moon but when they try to study it a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station in a rescue mission is planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry o'connell along for the ride after some zerogravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel now stranded on mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home after all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth mission to mars is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it so let's start with one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film that's it everything else fails the failure isn't de palma's fault he's working from an atrocious script only during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission to mars come to life a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire dangermore dangerattempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes take it out and the plot isn't affected in any way the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes as does the rest of the film why is the ship's computer which sounds strangely like hal from uh able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach why are the characters such idiots because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them all the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this can't we find out these things in a less grating matter like maybe in a flashback the whole film is like that the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on they must tell us exactly what we're looking at every time sample dialogue from the film shot of mars astronaut a look there's mars astronaut b you sure that's mars astronaut a yeah that's mars all right astronaut c hey are you guys looking at mars that exchange isn't actually in mission to mars but i wouldn't be surprised if it were for all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well show and don't tell de palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten this is mentallychallenged filmmaking they assume the audience won't get what's going on so they explain everything five times over fourthgraders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted the principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission to mars never managing to do away with an apparent i'm just here to get a paycheck attitude cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines armin muellerstahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance and sinise hams it up with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavyhanded monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolenfromnolessthanthreemovies a lollipop to whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and subpar cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then and of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission to mars but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slowgoing leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters supposedly we're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the onecharacterdecidesnottoreturn ending of armageddon but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning me i alternated between the two there is only one good thing about the way mission to mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over",

                "my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love i love ralph fiennes i love uma thurman i love sean connery hell i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since a few months into the summer however i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times and that it had ended up in the midaugust dumping ground then in this final week before its official release i learned that it was not to be screened for critics and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations this is a lousy incoherent mess i would slam it harder if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine lovable actors but sets are ultimately empty and the performances are completely uninspired that's the main problem with the avengers for all it's hiphop flash and tidal waves none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired it's like a chore a bland exercise in superhero film making it also feels like its been cut to pieces clocking in at minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots this is just plain depressing the avengers is a film version of the popular s television show frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode i wasn't alive then i don't even watch television now i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective but judging from the reviews i've already read knowing the tv show just makes matters worse i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film based on what the film told me i gather that steed fiennes is some kind of british super guy somewhat like james bond and that dr peel thurman is just a really smart doctor who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits they are to work together under mother's orders mother is played by jolly jim broadbent while his coconspirator father is played by the equallytalented fiona shaw it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather his name is de wynter connery he is a crazy scottish guy our heroes had better stop him or else the weather will keep getting colder until they have to go to hell to warm up one of the film's few funny lines along the way there is subplot after subplot hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere feel perfunctory and ultimately make no sense for example our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos now killer bugs don't really go with the weathercontrolling theme of the film the purpose of the bugs other than to annihilate our heroes is never established they're never even directly connected to de wynter they're controlled by his crazy henchman played by eddie izzard the special effects aren't bad but they're loud obnoxious and intrusive like so many scenes in the film it seems present only to keep your attention from waning and i guarantee you it will wane i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think the avengers has clearly been chopped up and reassembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut in addition many of the sequences have irritating grainy film quality which makes it feel lowbudget the last scene is particularly bad the scenes that don't feature action should be electric thanks to our wonderful cast they aren't the action scenes should be electric because this is an action film they aren't either and what about this wasted cast oh it makes me weep with disappointment we're talking ralph fiennes here one of the best actors working today one of the best actors ever i love the guy i've loved all his films until this one he seems like he wants to understand the film but he's as lost as we are and thurman in all of her spectacular beauty and talent can't manage to look at home here i don't blame her completely for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting connery however seems the most out of it totally lacking any kind of focus or interest for that matter who is to blame is it the screenwriter don macpherson perhaps although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right is it the actors for god's sake no these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling i blame director jeremiah chechik who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with his best film benny joon is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor add to that a lack of experience in bigbudget action and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory if the avengers has a saving grace it's the set design the sets by stuart craig are big colorful and often pleasing to look at i like the final setpiece on de wynter's island even if none of it makes a bit of sense i admired the overhead view of the stairs showing dr peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score particularly in the opening credits but this stuff is routine good sets and music are nice but there's a lot more that needs to be here inspiration for instance would have been really nice maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story or a sense of purpose most of all though i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles damn this movie for not giving them the chance",

                "martial arts master steven seagal not to mention director has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in a hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movies suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that is martial art i'm sure the guy's good and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows although a tad haughty but these movies he makes are all the same a guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses although i kinda liked under siege of course this one as a change has a message that is drilled into our mind of course after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people so why do i watch his crap i usually don't i will never and you can hold me to this i will never pay to see this man's movies unless and only unless he's in a supporting role i e executive decision and i'd definitely pay if he dies i e executive decision but this one has a special place in my heart this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la mystery science theatre and this was a couple years before i had heard of mystery science theatre in this one seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greasedup typical shallow villain this time played by an oscarwinner to give the movie some more clout michael caine it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine has him bumped off or does he seagal is rescued by some inuits and falls in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one of caine's cliched henchmen played here with a lot of overacting by john c mcginley shoots the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory literally of course at one point seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up he even goes as far as to say i don't want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is i have no problem with violence i'm a huge john woo fan but he paints his films with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence in the films of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them at some points they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying a corny line to which seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them and does this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summer's con air but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewer's mind the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we can't take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job then at the end he spends a good minutes giving a speech just in case you didn't get the message from the trailers what seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously although maybe a couple do and any message he has is no only redundant but doesn't comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish as far as seagal and his acting he's rather boring he squints he kills period nothing else oh yeah there's corny oneliners i'm gonna reach out and touch someone of course he's the star and we're supposed to root for him and all so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks michael caine who's a great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold he does it well i guess but this is no alfie of coure no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him his big henchman john c mcginley is kinda boring as well but is not horrible and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid r lee ermey from full metal jacket as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailers and for seagal's ego and also look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey's assasins anyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagal's movies is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really a seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message which makes it more excrucitating to watch i mean if you do rent it and i don't reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last minutes but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one my extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock",

                "tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid unfortunately it's not bad in the way great colossal misfires like heaven's gate or ishtar were bad instead it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it was made in the first place with all the good scripts lying around hollywood unproduced how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen of course tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history he has appeared in over forty films which have ranged from the very good 's greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes down to the really bad 's tarzan the ape man with bo derek most of these films were just cheapie bmovies made in the thirties and forties starring exolympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps therefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer a different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others greystoke added a neverbeforeseen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the misguided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts tarzan and the lost city on the other hand has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue the script by bayard johnson and j anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come comic books have better plots than this the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy george of the jungle didn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established a quick opening narration tells of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage when the movie starts in he is a civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than a week however when a wicked archeologistgraverobber named nigel ravens steve waddington begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africa's last great secrets the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle at first jane refuses to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her apeman once the film gets going in its own sluggish way it delves into a series of jungle adventures as tarzan jane and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city most of the socalled adventures are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies ranging from raiders of the lost ark to the goonies when the movie is running short on action it includes a few greenpeacefriendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals releasing a baby elephant from a trap and throwing ivory tusks into the river the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality for instance when tarzan who was raised in the jungle is bit by a cobra he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semiexperienced weekend backpacker would do instead he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival of course one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is not to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city there is however a lost pyramid which i suppose is all the resourcestrapped fx department could come up with the special effects are not worthy of a madefortv movie which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open field strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isn't even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van dien's laughably stiff performance comes real close this movie proves what starship troopers only hinted at he cannot act but he sure looks wellgroomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle van dien is much too much of a prettyboy to be an effective tarzan he's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth i also wondered what the makeup department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa steve perry haircut waddington makes a decent villain although he's like a charmless version of belloq from raiders of the lost ark as jane the exmodel jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two but whenever a snake comes into the picture she is reduced to a hysterical mess however amidst all this complaining i do have one piece of good news

                "capsule in on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films especially assault on precinct that the new film comes off as his homage to himself to john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes for a writer and director of horror films supposedly an expert on horror it is a very bad mistake to make ghosts of mars is called a horror movie but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly lowpowered alien menace in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars carpenter would have grounds to sue this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct the thing and prince of darkness it is in fact surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience ghosts of mars takes place in the year mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear which is good for the film's budget it is never mentioned but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earthnormal again making it easier to film society has changed a bit by that time but it has advanced surprisingly little apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control and from carpenter's view women have really made a mess of things society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in years than we might expect it to change in ten the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct except that precinct yes precinct has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony instead of having the criminal napolean wilson this film has the criminal desolation williams instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face well ghosts of mars because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner but they essentially behave as human savages in another lapse of imagination the story is told in flashback flashback within flashback and flashback within flashback within flashback ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red yellow and black carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars red planet and ghosts of mars after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by i rate ghosts of mars a on the to scale and a on the to scale following the movie i showed my wife who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did carpenter's classic assault on precinct her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice",

                "it seemed like the perfect concept what better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh jim carrey's signed on too even better the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire proving that some people just couldn't take a joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy yes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn't funny it's not for lack of trying the farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most highconcept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them this of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely tooforgiving nature making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult soon enough charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second independent personality named hank a deepvoiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jumproping in the street then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks some have suggested that this isn't a problem because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work they're wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort 's there's something about mary 's outside providence was technically an earlier project the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected in mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleightofhand trick they'd have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work having been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment the brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote bythenumbers adolescent comedy the plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p waters renee zellweger who's in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that's entirely predictable from the getgo think charlie and irene will fall in love yeah me too the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely softtossed presenting an obvious problem when grossout humor loses its shock value it's no longer funny merely gross the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry take for example the subplot involving charlie's three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon the incongruity of it all is funny for a while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face but by the end of the film they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn't been dropped either that's too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn't go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax jim carrey is a gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in all of me it's a great showcase of flexibility and splitsecond roleshifting but none of it is terribly funny carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the roleshifting aren't set up in any meaningful way perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strongwilled irene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy clever or neither as such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straightlaced for a movie like this he like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected after viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked but i don't believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style if the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and i still think they are they'll rebound just fine even after that happens though i'll still consider me myself irene to be a highcaliber misfire",

                "lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode episode is a boring empty spectacle that features some nice special effects after the familiar 'a long time ago ' opening the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo ruled by queen amidala portman jedi knights quigon neeson and obi wan mcgregor are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade however this simple blockade is not all it seems and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers including facing the evil darth maul ray park they also meet the future darth vadar anakin skywalker jake lloyd star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking script direction and characters the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent there's no underlying tension and no urgent need to see what the outcome is the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story which doesn't help there's no snap to make the film work it moves at a plod the script is boring all the characters speak in morals especially anakins mother there's no group spirit evident here and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders it's evident that not much is going to happen the two leads are hideously boring static characters given little to do and too much time to do it quigon and obiwan hold no presence on film and give little for the audience to root for the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul if he had been given more screen time maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy anakin is annoying and unlikeable instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks although in the end none is provided in the film by him although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while queen amidala is a nothing in the film she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people ' and go googoo over anakin again her role will become more important in the later episodes and is given little to do here the actors don't help the movie much either liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy with little charm the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness there's little other explanation for it natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script but she delivers a spunky performance and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice there's very little talent evident with him it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there he's not even very 'cute ' the main claim of the film the special effects are okay there's nothing impressive about them yet they complement the story well the cgi takes away much of the human element however the battle droids for example the replacement for the stormtroopers are characterless little computer graphics lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers episode is just disappointing it's got high production values but little else the music is meandering except near the end the plot gives us noone to root for or even care for the effects are nice but dull the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should there's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair and many clich s are catered for throughout the film apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence episode is a dry affair that serves little purpose except to make money and to get us to watch episode to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film disappointing is barely the word rating",
                "first rule of fight club is don't talk about fight club this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film because quite frankly it's not even worth mentioning director david fincher seven has completely gone over the edge with crude humor an intolerable script and hours and minutes of pure torture i'm surprised i didn't walk out this just goes to show that hype kills it's very rare that a film so hyped up as fight club turns out to be noteworthy and this is no exception the story goes like this edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions until he meets marla helena bonham carter norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle when he spots her at a session that he also attended apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like literally living in pain why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me but things do get worse norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden brad pitt the two men develop a bond and go out to a bar and by golly after they get drunk the two pitiful characters fight how do they come up with this stuff anyway their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention and a club is formed out of all this mess there manages to lie a message fincher shows us that society is like robots we work in our jobs doing things step by step and want out our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are and we blame it on others call me crazy but this is common knowledge i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably even with two good actors and a solid actress they only manage to weaken the story i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp it just shows how desperate the script is for attention i guess brad pitt was right for this role because i felt like beating him up myself his bothersome and depressing character made me disgusted at his million fee it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more helena bonham carter however really had no purpose she just popped up on screen mumbled some lines smoked and left this continues for what seems like hours the film drags on and my headache gets bigger while fight club nears what i think might be the end unfortunately by then the film hits rock bottom though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere minutes it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace on a side note the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment won't do any good if everything else is in need of support also i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult when the film ends i'm just glad to get home and take some advil you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer or agree with ed norton when he says this is so f ing stupid",
                "as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved by telling stories and expressing opinions this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels hays hodges tommy lee jones and terry childers samuel l jackson they fought side by side in vietnam where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow that's against the rules of war but understandable in this story anyway under the specific circumstances certainly hodges is not complaining years pass hodges whose wounds make him unfit for action gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer childers is now a respected and muchdecorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould because of his excellent record childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ben kingsley cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops childers does what he has to do evacuate the family and protect the men under his command after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd more than yemeni men women and children are mowed down childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film did childers violate authorized u s military rules of engagement or are there simply no rules in war the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions the murder of innocent civilians has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u s where is the accusations from the arab leaders where is the u n the film ends without even telling the most interesting story what happens on the international arena this film in a way akin to films such as a few good men has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism these accusations are pretty heavy but also unfair what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now but is overdone contrived and unrealistic as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality that is precisely why it's not offensive it is completely unobjective many stories are started and never finished many questions are asked but never answered a lot of parallels are referring to nothing it seems that neither the director producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film is it about arab mentality america's foreign policies america's role in the world corruption in the higher circles it goes on and on it consists of countless stories but not a definable plot it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one i think that it is ironic because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was the exorcist which had a silly story but became a rather effective film in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism such as the impressive battle scenes his latest film does simply not engage i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe the characters feel designed unreal merely shadows with no life outside the conflict even the actors can not save this film from going under though both jackson and jones act admirably with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this it is not something that these great actors can boast of they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back jackson is gray and jones uninteresting the rest of the cast including ben kingsly blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks the time has come for the verdict on the charges of complete lack of objectivity i find this film guilty on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking i find it guilty but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty because of it's inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere not only when concerning the arab population i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood badguys this is very sad since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth however it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states and that it's not a coincidence that u s residents in the middle east including yemen are on constant maximum alert",
